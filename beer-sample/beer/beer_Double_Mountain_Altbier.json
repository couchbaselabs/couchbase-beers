{"_id":"beer_Double_Mountain_Altbier","brewery":"Double Mountain Brewery & Taproom","name":"Double Mountain Altbier","abv":"5.6","description":"This special German-style ale is still made faithfully in Dusseldorf, just down the road from Cologne. Our interpretation is light brown in color and cleanly malty, with a crisp hoppy bitterness in the finish. \r\nBrewed with organic Pilsner and Munich malt; Chocolate and wheat malt, and imported Spalt hops.","category":"German Ale","style":"German-Style Brown Ale\/Altbier","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
