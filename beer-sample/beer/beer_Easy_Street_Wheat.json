{"_id":"beer_Easy_Street_Wheat","brewery":"Odell Brewing","name":"Easy Street Wheat","abv":"4.6","description":"Light and refreshing, Easy Street Wheat is an unfiltered American-style wheat beer. Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers \"taking it easy\" and not filtering the beer. However, for ultimate enjoyment, we encourage you to work just a little harder in pouring it: just pour 2\/3 of the beer into a glass, swirl what's left to stir up the yeast, then pour the rest and enjoy.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
