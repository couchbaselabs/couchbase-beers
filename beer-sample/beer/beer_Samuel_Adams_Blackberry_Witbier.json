{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Blackberry_Witbier","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier","abv":"5.5","description":"We brewed this traditional witbier with orange peel and coriander, and then added a hint of blackberry. The flavor is very complex with malt and cereal notes, intense spice and citrus flavors and a smooth, sweet\/tart finish. It will be available in January in its own 6-pack and in the Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Brewmaster's Collection Variety 6 & 12-packs.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
