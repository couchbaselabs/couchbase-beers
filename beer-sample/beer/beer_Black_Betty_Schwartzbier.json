{"_id":"beer_Black_Betty_Schwartzbier","brewery":"Four Peaks Brewing","name":"Black Betty Schwartzbier","abv":"5","description":"This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc\/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.\r\n\r\nThe name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940\u00e2\u0080\u0099s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Schwarzbier","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
