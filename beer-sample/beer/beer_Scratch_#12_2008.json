{"_id":"beer_Scratch_#12_2008","brewery":"Troegs Brewing","name":"Scratch #12 2008","abv":"6.5","description":"In our never-ending pursuit of answering the burning question of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new, we present Scratch #12-2008, an IPA.\r\n \r\nThe IPA is a fickle beast; too much malt and you veer into a high-octane hopbomb, while too little hops can question a beer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virility. In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma. The Thames Valley yeast adds an earthy nod to traditional English IPAs, while the American hops provide a bold contrasting bitterness.\r\n \r\nBreath deep, relax, enjoy.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
