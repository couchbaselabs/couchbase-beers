{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Boston_Ale","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Boston Ale","abv":"4.94","description":"A smooth, refined version of a classic ale.\r\nSamuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Boston Ale was first brewed to celebrate the opening of our Boston Brewery. Like Samuel Adams Boston Lager\u00c2\u00ae, it was an old family recipe that was rescued by Jim Koch from his father's attic. Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Boston Ale, a Stock Ale, has a complex, caramel malt character balanced with distinct spicy and herbal hop notes. Our proprietary ale yeast imparts a variety of fruit and ester notes in both the nose and flavor which are indicative of the style.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
