{"_id":"beer_Anchor_Witbier_with_Brettanomyces","brewery":"Midnight Sun Brewing Co.","name":"Anchor Witbier with Brettanomyces","abv":"6.25","description":"This Belgian witbier begins with equal parts malted wheat and pale barley to create its traditional cloudy white appearance. The addition of Brettanomyces gives ANCHOR its trademark \"green apple\" or \"horse blanket\" aroma and lends tartness to the flavor and finish. At over 6% ABV, this ANCHOR's got a bit of more kick than most wits.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
