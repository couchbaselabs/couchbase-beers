The oak is very apparent in this rich and high gravity ale. Additional depth and complexity result in a woody and cask-like nose, with a pronounced vanilla flavor on the palate. As of 2007, the use of additional roasted malt has resulted in subtle bitternes to balance the natural sweetness.","category":"British Ale","style":"Strong Ale","updated":"2010-12-19 09:47:16"}
