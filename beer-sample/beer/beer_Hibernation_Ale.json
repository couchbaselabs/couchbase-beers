This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities.","category":"British Ale","style":"Old Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
