This is a bigger, bolder version of our mainstay Pecan Porter, with a richer finish. Two months on recently emptied Jack Daniels select barrels imparted a wonderful vanilla character from the oak and a pleasant amount of whiskey nose and flavor. All in all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really proud of the hard work and effort put into this beer. Our first attempt at brewing it and our first attempt at managing barrels has paid off for everyone! Seek out this beer, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put it off. There is a very limited number of kegs available and it might go fast\u00e2\u0080\u00a6","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
