The ugly duckling of the flower family. \r\n\r\nOh, but the secret it holds. Soak it in some water with the right companions and it surrenders its bouquet to use a corny flower metaphor. That unique hop flavor is the difference between a fine pale ale and more ordinary beers. \r\n\r\nDundee Pale Ale understands the secret of the hop flower\u00e2\u0080\u0094the power to turn an ordinary beer into something extraordinary. \r\n\r\nAnd the power to make you indescribably hoppy. \r\n\r\nA wonderfully balanced true pale ale. Cascade, Tomahawk, and Amarillo hops create a citrusy aroma with a smooth, crisp finish. A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
