{"_id":"beer_Backyard_India_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Cooperstown Brewing Company","name":"Backyard India Pale Ale","abv":"6.1","description":"\"Back Yard\" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term \"India pale Ale\" or \"I.P.A.\" is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop.","category":"British Ale","style":"English-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
