They are our beloved folks out in the field. Spanning all 26 of our states from the Pacific to the Atlantic, our Beer Rangers do their best to protect, to pour and to partake. And explore many a beer from many a brewery, they do. The fellows up in the Northwest kept calling for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore hops!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Soon it became a common theme across the land. Rangers, fans and craft lovers everywhere were searching for hoppier beers. \r\n\r\nSo, here it finally is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 New Belgium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foray into the true American India Pale Ales. Bring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral\/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor. Brewed with pale and dark caramel malts that harmonize the hop flavor from start to finish, Ranger is a sessionable splendor for all you hopinistas. Thank your Beer Ranger!","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
