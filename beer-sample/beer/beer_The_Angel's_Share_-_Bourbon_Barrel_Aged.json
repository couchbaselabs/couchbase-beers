{"_id":"beer_The_Angel's_Share_-_Bourbon_Barrel_Aged","brewery":"The Lost Abbey","name":"The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel Aged","abv":"12.5","description":"own in Kentucky and across the pond in Scotland, distillers who age their whiskeys for many years refer to the evaporation of the spirits from their barrels as \"The Angel's Share.\" We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree more. Each time a barrel is filled, a measure of liquid seeps into the oak and is lost for good.\r\n\r\nThis striking Strong Ale is brewed with copious amounts of Caramel malt to emphasize the vanilla and oak flavors found in freshly emptied bourbon or brandy barrels. The beer spends a year in oak before it is packaged for release. The beer is 12.5% ABV and is available in 375ml and 750ml bottles and on draft at inspired locations.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
