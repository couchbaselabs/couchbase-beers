{"_id":"beer_Sante_Fe_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Santa Fe Brewing Company","name":"Sante Fe Pale Ale","abv":"5.5","description":"Anything but a typical American Pale, Santa Fe Pale Ale is as full bodied as its most robust English counterparts, while asserting its American origin with a healthy nose resplendent with Cascade and Willamette hops. It finishes with a well-balanced combination of the subtle, almost Pilsner-like maltiness accentuated by the German yeast used to brew this Santa Fe classic, and a hop bite sufficient to leave a lingering smile on the face of any fan of American Pale Ales.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
