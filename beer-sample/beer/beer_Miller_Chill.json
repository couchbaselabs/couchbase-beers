Through all of our marketing efforts, beer drinkers will see that Miller Chill is a celebration and fusion of the best of two cultures, great light beer from America and the chelada style from Mexico. It's the new alternative in mainstream low-cal beers ... one that provides a crisper, smoother, more refreshing beer experience.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Light Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
