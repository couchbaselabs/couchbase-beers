We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve retrofitted a 15 barrel tank to perfectly produce a very special cask conditioned ale (so, we have a little time to play around during winters at the Delaware coast). This beer, known as Dogfish Head 75 Minute IPA is a blend of 60 and 90 Minute IPAs with a special whole leaf cascade dry-hopping session.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
