Characterized by its distinctive Mount Hood hop aroma and beautiful blonde color, Liquid Sunshine\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 is brewed at a low temperature to create a nice light dry finish. Using only the finest 2-row malted barley, wheat, rye, and great northwestern grown hops, this combination results in a clean, crisp, and uniquely refreshing beer. As usual, no artificial preservatives have been added to our beer during and\/or after the brewing process...\r\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing like it under the sun!!!","category":"North American Ale","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
