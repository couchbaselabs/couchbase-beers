{"_id":"beer_Black_Creek_Porter","brewery":"Black Creek Historic Brewery","name":"Black Creek Porter","description":"Porter is a dark-coloured beer developed in the 1750s. Porter has a heavier flavour and aroma and a slightly sweet taste. Its name probably originates in the belief that this strong, nourishing drink was ideal for hard-working porters and labourers. Black Creek Porter is wonderful on its own, or with salty snacks.\n\n","category":"Other Style","style":"Smoke Beer","updated":"2011-06-08 07:10:06"}
