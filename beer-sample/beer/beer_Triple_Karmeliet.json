{"_id":"beer_Triple_Karmeliet","brewery":"Brouwerij Bosteels","name":"Triple Karmeliet","abv":"8","description":"LOOK:\r\nTripel Karmeliet is a very refi ned and complex golden-to-bronze brew with a fantastic creamy head. These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\nVery refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nTripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine\r\ndryness.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
