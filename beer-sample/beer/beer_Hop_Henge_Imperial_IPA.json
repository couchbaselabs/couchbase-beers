Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever settle\u00e2\u0080\u009d philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\r\n\r\nLimited Availability April through June.\r\n\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\r\n\r\n-http:\/\/www.deschutesbrewery.com\/Brews\/Bond+Street+Series\/default.aspx\r\n\r\nAvailable April through June.\r\n\r\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards & Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to \u00e2\u0080\u009cImperial IPA\u00e2\u0080\u009d status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one is lovely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said taster Tom Conti. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey got it just right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a beautiful beer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concluded taster Gregg Glaser. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot for the timid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said taster Robert Lachman.\r\n\r\n-http:\/\/www.deschutesbrewery.com\/BrewPub\/OnTap\/125352.aspx","category":"North American Ale","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
