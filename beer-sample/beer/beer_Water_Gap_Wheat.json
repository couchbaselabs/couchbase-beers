{"_id":"beer_Water_Gap_Wheat","brewery":"Appalachian Brewing Company","name":"Water Gap Wheat","abv":"4.5","description":"This light refreshing wheat beer is sure to delight. Our special yeast and blend of malted and unmalted wheat provide the haze in our unfiltered style ale. This beer is traditionally served with a lemon slice on the side. \r\nThere are many water gaps along the Appalachian Trail. These water gaps were established where large rivers cut through the Appalachian Mountain Range. The Susquehanna River creates one of the more visually appealing water gaps just north of Harrisburg in the area at the Dauphin Narrows.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
