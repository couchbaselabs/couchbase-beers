The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. \r\n\r\nBuzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
