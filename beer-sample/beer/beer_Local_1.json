{"_id":"beer_Local_1","brewery":"Brooklyn Brewery","name":"Local 1","abv":"9","description":"In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, we forge barley malt and hops from Germany, aromatic raw sugar from Mauritius and yeast from Belgium into our latest beer, Brooklyn Local 1.\r\n\r\nBehind the full golden color you'll find an alluring aroma, a dynamic complex of flavors, Belgian flair, Brooklyn fortitude and a dusting of our special yeast. To create this beer, we use the old technique of 100% bottle re-fermentation, a practice now rare even in Europe. It gives this beer a palate of unusual depth. Enjoy it locally or globally, as an aperitif or with your favorite dishes. It is particularly nice with spicy seafood and with fine cheeses.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
