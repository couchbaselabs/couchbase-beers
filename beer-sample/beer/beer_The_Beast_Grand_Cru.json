{"_id":"beer_The_Beast_Grand_Cru","brewery":"Avery Brewing Company","name":"The Beast Grand Cru","abv":"14.9","description":"The Beast is a seducer - accommodating, complicated, powerful, dark and created to last the ages. With a deep burgundy color and aromas of honey, nutmeg, mandarin orange and pineapple, this massive and challenging brew has flavors akin to a beautiful Carribean rum. Dates, plums, raisins and molasses are dominant in a rich vinous texture. Cellarable for 10+ years.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
