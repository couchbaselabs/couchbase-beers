{"_id":"beer_Hog_Heaven_Barleywine","brewery":"Avery Brewing Company","name":"Hog Heaven Barleywine","abv":"9.2","description":"This dangerously drinkable garnet beauty is a hop lover's delight.  The intense dry-hop nose and the alcohol content are perfectly balanced for a caramel candy-like malt finish.  This is a serious beer for serious beer afficianados and it only gets better with age.  Cellerable for 3 years.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
