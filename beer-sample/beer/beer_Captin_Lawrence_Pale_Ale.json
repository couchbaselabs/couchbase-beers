{"_id":"beer_Captin_Lawrence_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Captain Lawrence Brewing Company","name":"Captin Lawrence Pale Ale","abv":"5.6","description":"One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale. This version is a true testament to the influences the Wild West had on my early brewing. My Pale Ale is loaded with US-grown Cascade, Crystal, and Columbus hops, so be sure to take a good sniff to enjoy their robust aromas before taking your first sip.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
