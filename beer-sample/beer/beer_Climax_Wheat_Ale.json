{"_id":"beer_Climax_Wheat_Ale","brewery":"Climax Brewing Copmany","name":"Climax Wheat Ale","abv":"5","description":"Hoffmann Hefeweizen is our newest offering and is a traditional German wheat beer made from 60% wheat malt and 40% barley malt. Wheat Ales such as this typically have banana and clove flavors but as Dave dislikes clove, he used a special yeast to strengthen the banana flavors. Hefeweizen is a nice, light, crisp summer beer that can be served with lemon or flavored syrups.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
