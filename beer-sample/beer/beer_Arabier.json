{"_id":"beer_Arabier","brewery":"Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers","name":"Arabier","abv":"9","description":"An arabier is a pure malt beer 8\u00c2\u00b0vol\/alc brewed with flower Nugget-hops from Poperinge. It has the special dry-hopping taste and aroma, so appreciated by beer lovers all over the world. It is one of the two main beers from De Dolle Brouwers throughout the year. Aging time is limited due to the fact that hop bitterness is declining with the time. Store arabier cool and dark and serve cool at 10\u00c2\u00b0C.
