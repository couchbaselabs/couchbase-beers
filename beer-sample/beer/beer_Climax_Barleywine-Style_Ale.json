Up front it has a hop nose and hop flavor on the tongue that fades into malty overtones with flavors of vanilla that go into chocolate. As it has aged, we've noticed flavors of dates and raisins as well.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
