{"_id":"beer_Lord_Chesterfield_Ale","brewery":"Yuengling & Son Brewing","name":"Lord Chesterfield Ale","abv":"5.4","description":"One of our distinct classic beers brewed since 1829, Yuengling Lord Chesterfield Ale has as much rich heritage as it does flavor and appeal. Crafted in a unique two-stage European brewing style for enhanced bitterness, it utilizes both conventional kettle hopping and dry hopping after fermentation resulting in a dry sharp finish. Brewed with select hops, its distinct robust flavor is derived from a delicate combination of sweet maltiness and lingering herbal bitterness. Lord Chesterfield Ale's bright gold color is complemented by a lightly laced foam head and fragrant zesty aroma. This fine Ale compares with the very best crafty-style beers. It pairs flawlessly with many foods including seafood dishes and fine cheeses.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
