{"_id":"beer_13th_Anniversary_Ale","brewery":"Stone Brewing Co.","name":"13th Anniversary Ale","abv":"9.5","description":"Stone 13th Anniversary Ale pours brilliant deep red with a light tan foam. Up front, the aroma is all piney, resinous and citrus hops. Upon tasting, the hops are still on the front, and they are balanced with the malty, toffee like flavors contributed from the blend of crystal and amber malts used in the brewhouse. The finish is deliciously bitter, with a touch of warmth provided by the 9.5% alcohol. Bitterness comes in at 90+ IBU.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
