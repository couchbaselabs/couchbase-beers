{"_id":"beer_World_Wide_Stout","brewery":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","name":"World Wide Stout","abv":"18","description":"Dark, rich, roasty and complex, World Wide Stout has more in common with a fine port than a can of cheap, mass-marketed beer. Brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley. Have one with (or as!) dessert tonight!","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
