{"_id":"beer_Imperial_Espresso_Porter","brewery":"Flying Fish Brewing Company","name":"Imperial Espresso Porter","abv":"8","description":"This robust dark brew has been created using rich Colombian dark roast coffee to celebrate our 10th anniversary in royal fashion. The enticing regal aromas of toffee and licorice lead to the coronation of taste; a palate of malty richness exhibiting chocolate and coffee notes, balanced by the noble and novel Mt. Rainer hop, all topped with a rich creamy crown. This very special offering will warm your soul and lift your spirits. Oh yeah, it also packs a royal kick at 8% alcohol.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
