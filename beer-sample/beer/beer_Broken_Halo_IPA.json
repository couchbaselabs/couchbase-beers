{"_id":"beer_Broken_Halo_IPA","brewery":"Widmer Brothers Brewing","name":"Broken Halo IPA","abv":"6","description":"\"Broken Halo IPA is a beer produced in the spirit of traditional IPA products shipped from the UK to India in the late 1800s. The almost excessive amounts of Cascade and Columbus hops used in Broken Halo give it notable citrus and grapefruit aromas and flavors. The beer bitterness measures high but tastes smooth due to the full-bodied, Caramel malt sweetness. The finish is juicy, clean, and short lived. A devilishly bold, heavenly smooth India Pale Ale.\"\r\n-Widmer Brothers Brewing Company","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
