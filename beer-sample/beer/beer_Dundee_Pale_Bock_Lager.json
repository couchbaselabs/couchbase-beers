The commencement address. Winter. \r\n\r\nBut take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094and an itchy wool robe\u00e2\u0080\u0094sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. \r\n\r\nSo when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.\r\n\r\nA traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Heller Bock\/Maibock","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
