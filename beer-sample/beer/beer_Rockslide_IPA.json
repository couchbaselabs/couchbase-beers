{"_id":"beer_Rockslide_IPA","brewery":"Fifty Fifty Brewing Co.","name":"Rockslide IPA","abv":"6.7","description":"If being in one of the coldest places in the US isn't extreme enough, the contents of this beer may very well redefine your commitment to the pursuit of hops. Rockslide IPA is brewed in the 'West Coast' style with aggressive amounts of American hops such as Amarillo, Centennial and Summit hops. You are greeted with a full frontal assault of citrus\/grapefruit\/pine hop character, followed up with malt to balance the mouthfeel. This beer is all about hops.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
