{"_id":"beer_Scratch_#11_2008","brewery":"Troegs Brewing","name":"Scratch #11 2008","abv":"4.9","description":"Next up, we present Scratch Beer #11-2008, a Bitter. Back in the day, we used to brew a little number called Tr\u00c3\u00b6egs ESB. Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous Tr\u00c3\u00b6egs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.\r\n\r\nWell hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stint at England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the ESB, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damn special.","category":"British Ale","style":"Ordinary Bitter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
