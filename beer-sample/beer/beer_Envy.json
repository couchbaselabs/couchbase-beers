{"_id":"beer_Envy","brewery":"Midnight Sun Brewing Co.","name":"Envy","abv":"7","description":"ENVY Imperial Pilsner obsessively desires to be better than the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most common lager. Envy vies for attention with its beautifully bright, golden color and tightly-formed crown. Intense yet true pilsner malt provides the perfect base for profuse citrus, floral and spicy hop flavor. Envy achieves distinction, making other beers turn green.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
