We've taken our Merry Monks' Ale and carefully aged it in bourbon barrels. The result is a fabulous unique ale, softened with hints of vanilla and oak, with an intriguing finish to it. Prophecy is a limited release so when it's here, be sure to grab a case or two to lay away before its gone. 9.3% ABV.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
