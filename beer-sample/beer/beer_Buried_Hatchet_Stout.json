{"_id":"beer_Buried_Hatchet_Stout","brewery":"Southern Star Brewing Company","name":"Buried Hatchet Stout","abv":"8.25","description":"Jet-black in color, this monster smells of coffee and chocolate.  The taste is much of the same, with hints of creamy toffee and roasted malt.  Smooth and delicious, this medium bodied ale is all about the malts, but has enough hop bitterness to be balanced.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
