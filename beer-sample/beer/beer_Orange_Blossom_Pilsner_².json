That's the approach we took with our latest offering. OBP Squared, with half the water, has 11% alcohol by volume-twice that of original OBP.\r\n\r\nThe result is a bold, distinct taste of its own. Made with twice as much real orange blossom honey, all-natural ingredients and no refined sugar, it really is the new king bee of beers.","category":"Other Style","style":"Fruit Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
