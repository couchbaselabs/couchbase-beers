{"_id":"beer_UFO_Raspberry_Hefeweizen","brewery":"Harpoon Brewery - Boston","name":"UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen","abv":"4.8","description":"We have added natural raspberry flavor to our UFO Hefeweizen to create this beer.  Consistent with the hefeweizen style, this beer is unfiltered and cloudy with a solid foamy head.  UFO Raspberry has a distinctive, hazy rose color.  The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish.","category":"Other Style","style":"Fruit Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
