Turbodog began as a specialty ale but has gained a huge loyal following and has become one of our three flagship brews.\r\n\r\nJust a bit stronger than our other brews, so . . .beware of the dog!","category":"North American Ale","style":"Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
