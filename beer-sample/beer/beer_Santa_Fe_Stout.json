{"_id":"beer_Santa_Fe_Stout","brewery":"Santa Fe Brewing Company","name":"Santa Fe Stout","abv":"5","description":"A hearty sip of the Santa Fe Stout delights one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taste buds first with a generous Irish serving of roast malt that rolls off the tongue with a creamy bitterness reminiscent of the finest coffee. Supported by the complex, yet light body only possible with a good Irish yeast strain, this coffee-like creaminess eventually yields to the warmth of a subtle variety of hops, and their mild, full flavor. A favorite with regular customers, this rare brew can occasionally be found on draft at restaurants in Santa Fe, but is more likely on tap at the Brewery's tasting room. Despite its intimidating dark color, this brew has an uncanny ability to convert those who claim not to like beer. The balance of flavors and complexity of aroma are recognized and appreciated by all who taste this fine brew.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
