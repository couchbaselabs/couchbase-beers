{"_id":"beer_Big_Swell_IPA","brewery":"Maui Brewing Co.","name":"Big Swell IPA","abv":"6.2","description":"India Pale Ale was developed in Burton, England, as a \"Super-Premium\" hoppy pale ale around 1800. The extra strength in alcohol and hops helped preserve the beer on its long export journeys to India and beyond. The style developed a following worldwide. Its flavor begins with a smooth, malty creaminess followed with a big burst of dry-hop flavor from English Kent Golding Hops. It then finishes with a lingering yet pleasant bitterness.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
