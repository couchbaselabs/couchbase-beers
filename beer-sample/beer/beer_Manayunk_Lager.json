{"_id":"beer_Manayunk_Lager","brewery":"Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant","name":"Manayunk Lager","abv":"6.4","description":"In strict accordance with the German purity law of 1516, we present to you this annually brewed festbier. Traditionally brewed in March and stored deep in the caves of Germany, this beer was brought to the masses to celebrate in October. It is a Vienna-style lager with a bit more malt and hops making a malty but balanced beverage. Copper-orange in color, it sports a toasty malt backbone that wonderfully compliments itself with many of our menu items.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
