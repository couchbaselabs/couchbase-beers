Brewed at a low temperature to create a refreshingly dry finish, Total Eclipse uses only the finest two row malted barley and hops grown in the great Pacific Northwest. This combination results in a clean, crisp, hand-crafted experience. Hoppy Brewing Company has never used any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors in any of its ales. The Hoppy label is your guarantee of purity. \r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of this world delicious!!!","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
