{"_id":"beer_Scratch_#21_2009_-_Artisan_Ale","brewery":"Troegs Brewing","name":"Scratch #21 2009 - Artisan Ale","abv":"7.8","description":"Scratch #21-2009 is an exercise in deconstruction and minimalism. This Belgian Ale has distinct roots in The Mad Elf minus some key components.\r\n \r\nThe cherries? Gone.\r\nThe honey? Gone.\r\nThe chocolate malt? Gone.\r\n\r\nWait, this sounds familiar. It almost sounds like a naked version of The Mad Elf.\r\n \r\nComing in just under 8% ABV, this unfiltered golden beauty shows off the pronounced yeast flavor that made The Mad Elf famous as well as a touch of alcohol and some mellow malt flavors.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
