{"_id":"beer_Yuengling_Black_and_Tan","brewery":"Yuengling & Son Brewing","name":"Yuengling Black and Tan","abv":"4.7","description":"Yuengling Original Black & Tan is a pioneer brand that models a traditional English Half & Half. Introduced in 1986, Yuengling produced one of the first hand-crafted draft blends to lead this style of American brewing. Black & Tan combines our popular Dark Brewed Porter and Premium Beer to create a brew that is rich and dark in color, with a well balanced flavor that finishes smooth and satisfying. It has a faint sweetness with hints of caramel and coffee from the dark roasted malts. One sip and you'll appreciate how Yuengling raised the bar with our Original Black & Tan.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
