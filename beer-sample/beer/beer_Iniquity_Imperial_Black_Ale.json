The six\u00e2\u0080\u0093point star is also the customary symbol of the brewer, representing the essential aspects of purity: water, hops, grain, malt, yeast, and of course, the brewer. Wishes of good fortune often collaborate with the brewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creativity to yield dramatic results. We carefully chose the name for this Imperial India Black Ale, Iniquity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a word opposing goodness. Why? This beer is contrary to what one may expect from an IPA; this is an ale as black as night. It is the antithesis of Unearthly. Some may consider it an immoral act to blacken an ale. We suggest they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on conventional standards. Allow the darkness to consume you. Cheers!","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
