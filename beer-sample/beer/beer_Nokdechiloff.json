It used as much malt as our brew house can handle and armloads of fresh hops and lovingly laid in our fermentor for four months. Massively malty and balanced with burly bitterness it is truly the king of beers, approaching wine in strength. A definitive one to have when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only having one. Adoringly served in brandy snifters to preserve precious properties.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
