{"_id":"beer_Cabin_Fever","brewery":"New Holland Brewing Company","name":"Cabin Fever","description":"Robust in character yet smooth in delivery, Cabin Fever is a roasty brown ale and a hearty, comforting companion for long, mind-bending winters. Its rye, roast and raisin notes play off a subtle caramel sweetness and culminate in a dry finish. Excellent with roasts, stews, caramelized onions and snowfall.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
