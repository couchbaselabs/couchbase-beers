{"_id":"beer_Blonde_Lager","brewery":"Rahr & Sons Brewing Company","name":"Blonde Lager","abv":"4.5","description":"It's our very first beer - golden medium-bodied and brewed as a traditional Munich Helles style pale lager. It features a rounded maltiness without being too heavy. And like every proud Texan, it has a good head, is pleaseant but never overly sweet.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
