{"_id":"beer_Bourbon_County_Stout","brewery":"Goose Island Beer Company - Clybourn","name":"Bourbon County Stout","abv":"13","description":"Brewed in honor of the 1000th batch at our original Clybourn brewpub. A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with thick foam the color of a bourbon barrel. The nose is an intense mix of charred oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and smoke. One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer. A great cigar beer.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
