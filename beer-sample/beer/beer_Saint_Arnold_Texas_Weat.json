{"_id":"beer_Saint_Arnold_Texas_Weat","brewery":"Saint Arnold Brewing","name":"Saint Arnold Texas Weat","abv":"3.9","description":"A refreshing, flavorful filtered wheat beer. The perfect beer to accompany a meal or for a summer's day. The wheat contributes a lighter flavor while maintaining a rich body. The beer has a light hop profile -- just enough to give the beer balance and complexity. The light fruitiness is derived from a K\u00c3\u00b6lsch yeast strain. A chill haze may be present, which is a characteristic of wheat beers. \r\n\r\nSaint Arnold Texas Wheat is best consumed at 40-45\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
