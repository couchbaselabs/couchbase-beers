Double malt, double hops - do the math, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s academic. This brew has twice the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big enough to share with the one you love. And isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that what it's all about?","category":"North American Ale","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
