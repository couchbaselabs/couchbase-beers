{"_id":"beer_Ipswich_Oatmeal_Stout","brewery":"Mercury Brewing Company","name":"Ipswich Oatmeal Stout","abv":"7","description":"Deep, rich, and malty with hints of chocolate and coffee. It's what espresso would be if it had the gumption to be beer. We use three different hop additions, specially selected crystal malts, roasted barley, and oatmeal to give it a soft and silky mouth feel. Makes a great dessert. Or meal.","category":"British Ale","style":"Oatmeal Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
