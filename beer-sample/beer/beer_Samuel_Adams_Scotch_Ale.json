{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Scotch_Ale","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Scotch Ale","abv":"5.4","description":"This is a brew for adventurous beer drinkers. It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey. This unique malt gives Samuel Adams\u00ae Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel Adams\u00ae Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish.","category":"British Ale","style":"Scotch Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
