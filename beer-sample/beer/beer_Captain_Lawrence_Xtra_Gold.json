{"_id":"beer_Captain_Lawrence_Xtra_Gold","brewery":"Captain Lawrence Brewing Company","name":"Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold","abv":"10","description":"This beer is the result of the marriage between two very distinct beer styles; the Belgian Tripel & American IPA. We have taken the best qualities from both styles and allowed them to shine through. The fruity and spicy notes from the imported Belgian yeast strain & the pungent flavors and aromas of the American grown Amarillo hops flow seamlessly together to create this flavorful ale.  Straight from the Captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
