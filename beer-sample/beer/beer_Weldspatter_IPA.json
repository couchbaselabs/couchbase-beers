{"_id":"beer_Weldspatter_IPA","brewery":"Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company","name":"Weldspatter IPA","abv":"7","description":"Weldspatter IPA is not your typical India Pale Ale. First of all, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as aggressively hopped as many other American versions. Second, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite as pale. Balance is a lovely thing in beers and Weldspatter IPA achieves balance without compromising hop presence. The hop flavor and aroma abound, but the bitterness is held in check to give our IPA a pleasant malt character as well.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
