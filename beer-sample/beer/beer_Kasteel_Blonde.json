{"_id":"beer_Kasteel_Blonde","brewery":"Van Honsebrouch","name":"Kasteel Blonde","abv":"11","description":"Slightly dangerous beer - tastes like an 8% blonde, delivers like nothing else. A little tart around the edges, due to the higher alcohol content, but otherwise a pleasant strong pils taste : not too much hop on the palate.","category":"North American Ale","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
