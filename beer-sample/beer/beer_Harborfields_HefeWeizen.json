Shipping over long distances is not always a friend to beer. \r\n\r\nNamed for the Centerport-Greenlawn area of Long Island that is home to the Blind Bat Brewery, Harborfields Hefeweizen goes great with fish, chicken, or a summer salad. Some even like it with brunch! (Please enjoy your waffles responsibly.)","category":"German Ale","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
