{"_id":"beer_Brilliant_Barstool","brewery":"Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant","name":"Brilliant Barstool","abv":"5.1","description":"A true English session ale brewed in the pale ale style using ye olde techniques of yesteryear. Specially crafted to inspire you and your thirstiest mates barstool conversations. Light copper in colour. This pint is quite malty with just enough East Kent hops for a nice, earthy hoppiness. Naturally cask conditioned, this may be served a little cold for a true Brit but is a \r\ncomplimentary double nod to one of the 1st beer styles. Cheers mate!","category":"British Ale","style":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
