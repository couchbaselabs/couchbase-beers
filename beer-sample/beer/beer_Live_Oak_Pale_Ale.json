{"_id":"beer_Live_Oak_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Live Oak Brewing","name":"Live Oak Pale Ale","description":"A delicious example of the \"neo-classical\" American beer style. It has a beautiful copper color and is topped with a thick rich head. With a hint of ale fruitiness in the nose, Pale Ale starts out malty, finishes dry and has plenty of Cascade hops in between. It is sure to satisfy the most discerning ale aficionados.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
