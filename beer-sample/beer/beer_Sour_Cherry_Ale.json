{"_id":"beer_Sour_Cherry_Ale","brewery":"Steamworks","name":"Sour Cherry Ale","description":"An intriguing fruit beer brewed with fresh sour cherries.\r\n\r\nOur Sour Cherry Ale is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with cherries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Montmorency cherries from a local orchard in the Fraser Valley. The result is a most intriguing beer with an elegant cherry perfume, a tart, fruity flavour, and a subtle almondy finish.","category":"Other Style","style":"Fruit Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
