{"_id":"beer_Sloth","brewery":"Midnight Sun Brewing Co.","name":"Sloth","abv":"10.2","description":"SLOTH Belgian-style Imperial Stout is deliberately dark as hell. The pour is slow and sluggish. Its head is menacing, becoming torn and tattered Belgian lace on the sides of the glass as you cautiously consume this brew\u00e2\u0080\u0094sip by insidious sip. \r\n\r\nThe aroma is sweet from heavy malt and big alcohol with notes of vanilla, coconut and whiskey from the oak. The depth & breadth of roasted malt flavors loiters on the palate while the robust finish lingers, well, forever. \r\n\r\nSLOTH...Just add couch.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
