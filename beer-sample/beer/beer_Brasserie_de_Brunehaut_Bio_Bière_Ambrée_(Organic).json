Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.\r\nHazy amber to brown coloured beer, with a fluffy off-white head. Nice aroma of spices, yeast and oak.  The alcohol subtle. Flavour is moderately spicy and slightly fruity, with balanced hops. \r\nThis beer is certified organic.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
