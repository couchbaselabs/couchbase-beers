We honor the Harvest & Holidays each year by brewing a traditional Barleywine style ale, using a variety of ingredients. The Label, created by local artist Janis Taylor, is a folksy woodcut based on the tale of John Barleycorn in verse.\r\n\r\nBrewed in small 10-barrel batches with Certified Organic barley malt, this crimson hued ale has a sweet caramel nose with a zesty spicy, citrus taste. It has a slight hop finish and leaves a warm, tingling sensation on the tongue. A great winter warmer!\r\nStarting Gravity \t1.098\r\nFinish Gravity \t1.020\r\nABV \t9.5\r\nIBU \t96\r\n\r\n-http:\/\/www.madriverbrewing.com\/pages\/brews\/john_barleycorn.html","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
