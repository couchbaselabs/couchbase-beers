{"_id":"beer_Titan_IPA","brewery":"Great Divide Brewing","name":"Titan IPA","abv":"6.8","description":"Traditionally India Pale Ales, the hoppiest of all pales, were brewed with more alcohol and large quantities of hops in order to survive the lengthy ocean journey from the U.K. to India. Unlike our brewing forefathers, Great Divide enjoys the modern benefits of refrigeration and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any plans to ship Titan IPA to India. Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples \u00e2\u0080\u0093 independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness. As a big, aggressively hopped India Pale Ale, Titan IPA fills this bill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 beginning with piney hop aromas and citrus hop flavors, and finishing with a rich, malty sweetness that is carefully balanced with crisp hop bitterness.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
