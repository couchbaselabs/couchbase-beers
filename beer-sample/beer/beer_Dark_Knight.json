{"_id":"beer_Dark_Knight","brewery":"Moose's Tooth Pub and Pizzeria","name":"Dark Knight","abv":"5.4","description":"Dark Knight (Baltic Porter) A Baltic porter is kind of a cross between an English porter and an Imperial Stout. Ours features a rich maltiness with hints of caramel, toffee and chocolate in both the flavor and aroma. Restrained hopping contributes a smooth full finish.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
