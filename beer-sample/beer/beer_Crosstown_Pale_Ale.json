{"_id":"beer_Crosstown_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Hopworks Urban Brewery","name":"Crosstown Pale Ale","abv":"5.3","description":"This beer bridges east and west with a lane dedicated to riders who aren't afraid to get dirty. Three kinds of organic caramel malts and a 24 pound whirlpool hop bomb keep things interesting while the wheels go round and round. Cheers to narrow knobbies, kazoos, and more cowbell!","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
