{"_id":"beer_Bridgeport_India_Pale_Ale","brewery":"BridgePort Brewing","name":"Bridgeport India Pale Ale","abv":"5.5","description":"Our award-winning IPA sparkles with effervescence, the result of natural-conditioning, a process where the beer is double-fermented in each bottle, keg or cask. Brewed with a blend of five hop varieties, BridgePort IPA presents a floral, citrusy aroma and full hop flavor, while downplaying the bitterness.  The beer pours smooth in the glass, emitting its signature golden glow.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
