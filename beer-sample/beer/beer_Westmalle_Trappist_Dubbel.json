{"_id":"beer_Westmalle_Trappist_Dubbel","brewery":"Brouwerij Abdij der Trappisten van Westmalle","name":"Westmalle Trappist Dubbel","abv":"7","description":"Westmalle Dubbel is a dark, reddish-brown Trappist beer with a secondary fermentation in the bottle. The creamy head has the fragrance of special malt and leaves an attractive lace pattern in the glass. The flavour is rich and complex, herby and fruity with a fresh-bitter finish. It is a balanced quality beer with a soft feel in the mouth and a long, dry aftertaste. The Dubbel contains 7% alcohol.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
