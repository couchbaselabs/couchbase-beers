{"_id":"beer_Negra_Modelo","brewery":"Grupo Modelo","name":"Negra Modelo","abv":"6","description":"Negra Modelo has long been the dark beer alternative for Mexican beer drinkers. It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. \r\nNegra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber\/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.\r\n\r\nThere is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
