{"_id":"beer_Jinx","brewery":"Magic Hat","name":"Jinx","abv":"6.9","description":"An ale for dancing bonfires and falling leaves.\r\nJinx prepares the bones for snow. It's a full bodied strong ale the color of maple's golden leaves in the season's fading sun.  Finished with a touch of peat-smoked whiskey malt, Jinx offers sweet, toasty aromas of caramel, tea, and smoke.  Deep flavors of dark candy sugar and warming alcohol notes are balanced by a spicy hop bitterness.","category":"British Ale","style":"Scotch Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
