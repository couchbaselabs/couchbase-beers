{"_id":"beer_Dom_Blonde_K\u00c3\u00b6lsch","brewery":"Appalachian Brewing Company","name":"Dom Blonde K\u00c3\u00b6lsch","abv":"5","description":"The first in a series of two new specialty beers coming this year! This K\u00c3\u00b6lsch-styled ale is clean, crisp, and delicately balanced. It has very subtle pear flavors and aromas. The subdued maltiness leads to a pleasantly refreshing finish. A fantastic summer brew!\r\n\r\nThe K\u00c3\u00b6lner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), is one of the best-known architectural monuments in Germany and has been Cologne's most famous landmark since its completion in the late 19th century. True K\u00c3\u00b6lsch can only be brewed if the brewery has a view of this famous cathedral, thus its\u00e2\u0080\u0099 appearance on our tap markers.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
