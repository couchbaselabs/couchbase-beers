{"_id":"beer_Square_Feet_Wheat","brewery":"Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company","name":"Square Feet Wheat","description":"Square Feet Wheat is loosely based on a Berliner Weisse style of beer from Germany. It has a refreshing, yet slight wheat and malt sweetness that is supported by a distinct hop presence. On hot Summer days, Square Feet Wheat will cool you off. Bring it along to pool parties, picnics and backyard cookouts. Instead of a boring wedge of lemon or orange, try Square Feet Wheat with a splash of raspberry extract or a dash of essence of Woodruff \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both a customary addition to Berliner Weisse beers in Berlin.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
