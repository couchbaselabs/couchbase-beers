{"_id":"beer_Mermaids_Red_Ale","brewery":"Coronado Brewing Company","name":"Mermaids Red Ale","description":"A well balanced, medium-to full bodied beer, red in color and very flavorful. The red color and slight caramel-roasted flavor comes from generous amounts of caramel malts and a touch of chocolate malts. Well hopped to balance the malty sweetness, and dry-hopped with cascade for a full hop flavor and aroma.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
