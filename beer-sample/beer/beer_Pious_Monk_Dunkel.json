{"_id":"beer_Pious_Monk_Dunkel","brewery":"The Church Brew Works","name":"Pious Monk Dunkel","abv":"5.2","description":"Gold Medal Winner of the Great American Beer Festival. Our beer is fairly dark in color, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid. It is a perfect example that dark beers are not always strong beers. The body is surprisingly mellow, and the alcohol content is a bit lower than most people might think. It has a wonderfully clean and roasty aroma. Hop bitterness levels are kept in line, but is has a noticeable hop flavor.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
