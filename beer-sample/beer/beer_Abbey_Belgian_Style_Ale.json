{"_id":"beer_Abbey_Belgian_Style_Ale","brewery":"New Belgium Brewing","name":"Abbey Belgian Style Ale","abv":"7","description":"Winner of four World Beer Cup medals and eight medals at the Great American Beer Fest, Abbey Belgian Ale is the Mark Spitz of New Belgium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lineup - but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start out that way. When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
