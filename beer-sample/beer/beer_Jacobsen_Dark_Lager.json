{"_id":"beer_Jacobsen_Dark_Lager","brewery":"Carlsberg Bryggerierne","name":"Jacobsen Dark Lager","abv":"5.8","description":"Original Dark Lager is brewed according to J.C. Jacobsen's original recipe. The colour is chestnut. It has a Hersbrucker hiop aroma while the floor malted Munich malt adds a caramel character. The carbonisation is gentle and the hop bitterness is soft. Enjoy at 6-8C.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
