{"_id":"beer_Ten_Fidy","brewery":"Oskar Blues Grill and Brew","name":"Ten Fidy","abv":"10","description":"Ten FIDY Imperial Stout - Now (11-21-07) available in cans, our winter seasonal beer is immensely viscous and loaded with neck-deep flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cocoa and oats.\r\n\r\nIt's the beer equivalent of decadently rich milkshake made with malted-milk balls and Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best chocolate ice cream. Ten FIDY is about 10% ABV and is made with enormous amounts of two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops. Its huge-but-comforting flavors hide a whopping 98 IBUs that are deftly tucked underneath the beer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mountains of malty goodness.\r\n\r\nTen FIDY is the ultimate Rocky Mountain winter warmer, and further proof of the creative muscle of our beloved brewing staff. Look for fourpacks of Ten FIDY in select beer stores in Colorado. Out of state? We hope to send a few cases to a few of our other states in early '08.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
