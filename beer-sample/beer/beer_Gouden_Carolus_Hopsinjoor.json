These hops were fractioned at several times in the cooking process in order to keep a maximum of aroma.\r\n\r\nRegarding to taste we can say that the beer has a gentle, but nevertheless bitter aftertaste. Gold-yellow colour. Hoppy aroma.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
