This stout is brewed with a hint of coffee and vanilla then aged in oak bourbon barrels. Our process ensures that strong bourbon undertones come through in the finish in every batch we brew. We recommend decanting at room temperature and best enjoyed in a brandy snifter.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
