{"_id":"beer_Black_Orchard","brewery":"The Bruery","name":"Black Orchard","abv":"5.7","description":"Black Orchard is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned Belgian-style black wheat beer, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack wit\u00e2\u0080\u009d, if you will. This dark but surprisingly light bodied beer is very drinkable while still having character and complexity. Chamomile is added for its floral aroma, while the coriander and citrus peel give the characteristics of a traditional witbier.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
