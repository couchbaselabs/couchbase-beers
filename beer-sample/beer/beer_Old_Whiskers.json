{"_id":"beer_Old_Whiskers","brewery":"Midnight Sun Brewing Co.","name":"Old Whiskers","abv":"4.5","description":"This is our perennial summer seasonal beer, first brewed in Summer 1995 when we opened. \r\n\r\nAffectionately called \"Spunky and Chunky\", Old Whiskers Hefeweizen is a traditional Bavarian-style unfiltered wheat beer. Created with equal parts malted wheat and pale two-row malt, Old Whiskers is lightly hopped to style. A unique Bavarian strain of yeast imparts a clove- or banana-like aroma and flavor. (We swear we did not put cloves into the brew. It is the magical powers of The Yeast.) Old Whisker is delicious and refeshing--the perfect summer quencher, served with or without a slice of lemon.","category":"German Ale","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
