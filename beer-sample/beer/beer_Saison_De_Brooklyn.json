{"_id":"beer_Saison_De_Brooklyn","brewery":"Brooklyn Brewery","name":"Saison De Brooklyn","abv":"6.8","description":"The second beer of the Brewmaster's reserve line, Saison de Brooklyn is brewed in the style produced by old farmhouse breweries in Belgium and France. Well-hopped and fermented to a crisp dryness, Saisons were brewed in the spring to sustain farmers through the summer. Saison de Brooklyn is boldly hoppy, dry and flinty, with a bright spicy, citric aroma and pillowy white head. This beer has remarkable versatility with food, complementing spicy dishes particularly well.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
