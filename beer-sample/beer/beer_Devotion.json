{"_id":"beer_Devotion","brewery":"The Lost Abbey","name":"Devotion","abv":"6.25","description":"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been a simple life \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sustain.\r\n\r\nNearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
