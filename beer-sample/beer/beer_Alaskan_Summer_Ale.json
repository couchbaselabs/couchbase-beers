{"_id":"beer_Alaskan_Summer_Ale","brewery":"Alaskan Brewing","name":"Alaskan Summer Ale","abv":"5.3","description":"Based on the traditional style of K\u00c3\u00b6lsch beer brewed in Cologne, Germany.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Summer Ale balances a softly malted palate with the clean freshness of Hallertauer hops. In the tradition of the style, neither overpowers the other. Both hops and malt come together to refresh and renew the palate. The straw-gold color and easy drinkability are an enjoyable way to celebrate summer.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Summer Ale is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall Juneau receives each year.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
