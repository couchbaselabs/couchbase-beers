This fine English ale has been aged in freshly emptied Kentucky oak whisky barrels. The barrel aging has given this already big ale a beautiful whiskey nose along with notes of vanilla and oak. A perfect ale for sipping around a winter fire.","category":"Other Style","style":"Winter Warmer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
