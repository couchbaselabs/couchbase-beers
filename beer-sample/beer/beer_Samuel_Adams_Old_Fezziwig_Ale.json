Bursting with spices of the season and a remarkably full body, it helps those long winter nights pass much quicker. The full body hits the palate first with a depth of malt character ranging from sweeter toffee and caramel notes to the more dark, roasty chocolate notes. Then come the spices in full force. Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel dance on the tongue bringing with them the celebratory spirit that goes hand in hand with the season.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
