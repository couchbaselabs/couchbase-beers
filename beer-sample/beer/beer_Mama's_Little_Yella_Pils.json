Mama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and a blend of traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. Our first canned lager, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast.\r\n\r\nThis tasteful reality Czech is the perfect antidote for the watered-down versions of pilsner clogging America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shelves. And Mama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally honoring consumer requests for a delicious but less-challenging beer. (Hey, we like a good low-dose session beer, too.) Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March.\r\n\r\nSadly, the Feds rejected our \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake Two and Call Us in the Morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d line on the can.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Pilsener","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
