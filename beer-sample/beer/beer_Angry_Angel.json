{"_id":"beer_Angry_Angel","brewery":"Big Boss Brewing Company","name":"Angry Angel","abv":"4.5","description":"Our K\u00c3\u00b6lsch is a refreshingly pale German style Ale. It is cold fermented and cold conditioned to achieve a beautiful balance between biscuit malt flavors and floral hop notes. It is light bodied and finishes somewhat dry to enhance it's easy drinking nature.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
