{"_id":"beer_Frambozen","brewery":"Steamworks","name":"Frambozen","description":"A ruby-red raspberry beer with a luscious, pink head\r\n\r\nOur Frambozen is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with raspberries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Fraser Valley raspberries. The result is a ruby-red fruit beer with a intense raspberry flavour, a nice tart finish and a luscious pink head.","category":"Other Style","style":"Fruit Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
