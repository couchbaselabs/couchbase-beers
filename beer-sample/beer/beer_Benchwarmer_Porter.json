{"_id":"beer_Benchwarmer_Porter","brewery":"Cooperstown Brewing Company","name":"Benchwarmer Porter","abv":"6.4","description":"\"Benchwarmer\" is a very smooth Porter brewed in accordance with the original \"high gravity\" porters of early London. More than 4% chocolate malt, which is the most similar to the brown malts of the early 1700\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, gives \"Benchwarmer\" its dry coffee-like finish. It is fermented with the Ringwood yeast which is an excellent yeast for the brewing of porters. The widely accepted theory of how porter got its name is that it was a very popular beer among the porters who hauled produce and goods around the marketplace of early industrialized London.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
