{"_id":"beer_Fallen_Angel","brewery":"Midnight Sun Brewing Co.","name":"Fallen Angel","abv":"8","description":"Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale, brewed on 6-6-6, is named in the tradition of Belgian golden strong ales--after the devil himself. \r\n\r\nMidnight Sun's Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale is a traditional Belgian-style golden ale--beautiful gold in color with tiny, conniving bubbles forming a very thick, meticulous head. Effervescent and crisp, this seriously delicious elixir tempts the palate with apple (oh so Garden of Eden), pear and a little earthy mustiness. Fallen Angel captivates your senses with its lightness and brightness while its 8% ABV strength breathes fire into your soul, warming you from the inside out. \r\n\r\nAngel-like in appearance, the devil is in its strength. \r\n\r\nWith its introduction in 2006 and its immediate cult following, Fallen Angel is now brewed and released about once a year.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
