{"_id":"beer_Base_Camp_Golden_Ale","brewery":"Fifty Fifty Brewing Co.","name":"Base Camp Golden Ale","abv":"4.9","description":"The lightest of FiftyFifty's ales, Base Camp is a thirst quenching delight. Pale straw to light gold in color, this beer has a mild malt flavor combined with light bitterness and hop flavor. This beer finishes dry and is very light and refreshing on the palate. Base Camp is a \"session beer\", meaning you can easily toss back a few in one sitting. So go ahead, pull up a chair and camp out for awhile.","category":"North American Ale","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
