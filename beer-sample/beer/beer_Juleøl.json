{"_id":"beer_Jule\u00c3\u00b8l","brewery":"Aass Brewery","name":"Jule\u00c3\u00b8l","abv":"5.9","description":"The Norwegian Jule\u00c3\u00b8l can be traced back more that 1000 years. The \"Gulatinglov\", one of the first Norwegian laws written in the 9th century, has a chapter on brewing beer for the midwinter celebration in January. The festivities were held to celebrate the Norse Gods; Odin, Fr\u00c3\u00b8y and Njord as well as the \"return\" of the sun.\r\nFurthermore, the tradition was adopted by the Vikings that brought Christianity to the country between 1000 and 1100. They moved the tradition to December in connection with the birth of Jesus. \r\nIn those days a farmer that did not set aside the best crop to produce the beer could lose his house to the king and the church. The law has been changed, but we promise you that we still use the very best of malt, yeast, hops, and pure Norwegian water to produce our Christmas beer.\r\n\r\nAass Jule\u00c3\u00b8l has won most of the Norwegian Jule\u00c3\u00b8l taste test conducted over time. For those of you that know what \"lutefisk\" is, Aass Jule\u00c3\u00b8l is the perfect choice of beverage to this traditional Norwegian dish.","category":"North American Ale","style":"Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
