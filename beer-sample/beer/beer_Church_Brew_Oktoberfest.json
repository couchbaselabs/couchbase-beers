{"_id":"beer_Church_Brew_Oktoberfest","brewery":"The Church Brew Works","name":"Church Brew Oktoberfest","abv":"5.2","description":"Our Oktoberfest is a light amber colored beer.  It is malty in both flavor and aroma making it a delicate beer which is very drinkable. The hop bitterness is kept low to accentuate the maltiness.  Notice the crisp clean character and enjoy.  We brewed three batches of this beer so that we can bottle some of it in order to enhance our bottle beer selection.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
