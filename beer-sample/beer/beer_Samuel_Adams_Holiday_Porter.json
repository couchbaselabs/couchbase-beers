{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Holiday_Porter","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Holiday Porter","abv":"5.8","description":"A Traditional, British style. Robust and full bodied.  Introduced as a member of the Winter Classics Mix Pack in 2004, Samuel Adams\u00ae Holiday Porter with its rich malt complexity has become a favorite among our winter seasonal brews. In total, five varieties of malted barley are used in the brewing process including a variety of German malt called Carafa\u00ae. The Carafa\u00ae gives our Holiday Porter its smooth, roasted malt character. Add generous portions of imported hops to the mix and one has a brew that is both robust and high in drinkability.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
