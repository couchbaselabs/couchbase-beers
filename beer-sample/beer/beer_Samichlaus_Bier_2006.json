{"_id":"beer_Samichlaus_Bier_2006","brewery":"Schloss Eggenberg","name":"Samichlaus Bier 2006","abv":"14","description":"Brewed only once a year on December 6. Samichlaus is aged for 10 months before bottling. This beer is perhaps the rarest in the world. Samichlaus may be aged for many years to come. Older vintages become more complex with a creamy warming finish.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
