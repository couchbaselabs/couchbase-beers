{"_id":"beer_Sam_Adams_Light","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Sam Adams Light","description":"Great tasting yet drinkable, with a clean smooth finish.  Sam Adams Light\u00ae is not just a lighter version of our Samuel Adams Boston Lager\u00ae but rather the culmination of over two years of tireless research and brewing trials to create a flavorful Light beer. And it has proved to be worth the wait. Brewed using only the finest two row malt and German Noble hops it has a smooth, complex roasted malt character that is superbly balanced with the subtle orange fruit notes of the Noble hops. Sam Adams Light\u00ae finishes crisp and smooth without any lingering bitterness, leaving you yearning for more.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Light Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
