{"_id":"beer_Highland_Scottish_Ale","brewery":"Storm Brewing","name":"Highland Scottish Ale","description":"While hugely popular in Scotland, this style of beer escapes most North Americans. Designed and brewed by the Scottish punk rocker David \u00e2\u0080\u009cMalty\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macanulty, this creamy, nutty, malty, dark ale is true to its origins. David drives James crazy over this beer, insisting on rigid fermentation temperatures, traditional mild hops for bittering, and even some weird caramelizing ritual as the kettle is being filled. The beer continues to undergo subtle evolutionary changes because the stubborn Scottish bastard will never be satisfied.","category":"British Ale","style":"Scotch Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
