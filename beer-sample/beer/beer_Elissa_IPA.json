{"_id":"beer_Elissa_IPA","brewery":"Saint Arnold Brewing","name":"Elissa IPA","abv":"6.6","description":"A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
