{"_id":"beer_Black_Hole","brewery":"Weyerbacher Brewing Company","name":"Black Hole","abv":"7","description":"Coming in at an ABV of 7.0%, Our Black Hole satisfies the transition from dark ale to stout. We think of this as slightly \"Porter-ish\" with a strong malt body and a very light hop finish. This is brewed year round and is available in Pennsylvania in the regular Variety Pack.  This will help the ale drinker among us maintain their own balance!","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
