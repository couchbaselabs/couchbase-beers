{"_id":"beer_Adnam's_Suffolk_Special_Bitter","brewery":"Adnams & Co.","name":"Adnam's Suffolk Special Bitter","abv":"4.5","description":"Adnams Suffolk Special Bitter, at 4.5% alcohol by volume, is a dry, crisp, refreshing, and distinctly hoppy example of its style.\r\n\r\nThis beer is also available in some markets in tradtional cask form, as Adnams Bitter. At only 3.7% alcohol, Adnams Bitter is the classic English 'ordinary,' though we think you'll agree that there's full of flavor.\r\n\r\nDespite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels. Its continued commitment to quality and innovative packaging designs has made it Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fastest growing brewery over the last two years. To top it off, Adnams\u00e2\u0080\u0099 head brewer was recently chosen as Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brewer of the Year by a panel of his peers.","category":"British Ale","style":"Extra Special Bitter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
