{"_id":"beer_Maudite","brewery":"Unibroue","name":"Maudite","abv":"8","description":"Maudite has a deep amber-red color with a rocky foam head and an appealing aroma of wild spices and floral hop notes.  It is spicy, vinous, and deliciously complex with a crisp hop finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robust maltiness and  spiciness of our\r\namber-red ale is counterbalanced by an\r\nassertive hop finish, offering a distinctive\r\nflavor that is cognac-like in complexity.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
