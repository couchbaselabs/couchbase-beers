{"_id":"beer_Fancy_Lawnmower_Beer","brewery":"Saint Arnold Brewing","name":"Fancy Lawnmower Beer","abv":"4.9","description":"A true German-style K\u00c3\u00b6lsch. Originally brewed in Cologne, this beer is light yet has a sweet malty body that is balanced by a complex, citrus hop character. Multiple additions of German Hallertauer hops are used to achieve this delicate flavor. We use a special K\u00c3\u00b6lsch yeast, an ale yeast that ferments at lager temperatures, to yield the slightly fruity, clean flavor of this beer. Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn.\r\n\r\nSaint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower Beer is best consumed at 35-45\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
