With its famous cloudy sediment and its distinctive balance of malt, hops and fruity characters, the old 'Red Label' is a tasty slice of Coopers history. \r\n\r\nLittle has changed since Thomas Cooper produced his first batch of Coopers Sparkling Ale in 1862. It's still brewed naturally using the century old top fermentation method and it still tastes great! \r\n\r\nSparkling Ale contains no additives or preservatives.","category":"British Ale","style":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
