However, Beer Esteem is distinctly different from other California Commons. With a unique hop profile, a lager yeast not typically used for the style, and a \"Russian River\" twist, Beer Esteem is anything but \"Common.\"","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
