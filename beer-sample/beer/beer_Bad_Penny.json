{"_id":"beer_Bad_Penny","brewery":"Big Boss Brewing Company","name":"Bad Penny","abv":"5.5","description":"This dark brown ale is slightly sweet with a caramel and dark fruit finish. A show case of fine English malts, floor malted the old way. We use pale, chocolate, and crystal malts to produce a complex, but easy drinking dark ale. Very reminescent of northern English ales.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
