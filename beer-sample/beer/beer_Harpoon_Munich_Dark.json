{"_id":"beer_Harpoon_Munich_Dark","brewery":"Harpoon Brewery - Boston","name":"Harpoon Munich Dark","abv":"5.5","description":"Harpoon Munich Dark is a blend of dark malts that creates a deeper hue than some other beers brewed in this style. The grains which create a malty chocolate-like flavor also add a warm malty nose that mingles with the subtle hop aroma. This medium bodied beer is balanced quite well with a moderately bitter hop finish.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
