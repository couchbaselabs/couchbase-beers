{"_id":"beer_Samurai","brewery":"Great Divide Brewing","name":"Samurai","abv":"5.1","description":"Looking for something a little different? Brewed with rice and barley malts, Samurai is an easy drinking, unfiltered ale that changes the status quo for unfiltered beers. The addition of rice gives Samurai a slightly fruity, crisp, refreshing and clean taste. This is definitely not your everyday unfiltered beer.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
