{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Cream_Stout","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Cream Stout","description":"The Cappucino of beers. Roasty, smooth and sweet.\r\nSamuel Adams\u00ae Cream Stout is a true cream stout, balancing body and sweetness with the natural spiciness of grain and hand selected English hops. Our Brewers use generous portions of roasted chocolate and caramel malts as well as unroasted barley to impart a fullness of body, a roasty malt character and rich, creamy head. Its dark mahogany color make it almost as easy on the eyes as it is on the palate.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
