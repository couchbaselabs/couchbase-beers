{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Cranberry_Lambic","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic","abv":"5.9","description":"Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic is a fruit beer that draws its flavor not just from the cranberries it is brewed with, but also from the unique fermentation character imparted by the rare wild yeast strain. The result is a flavor rich in fruitiness and reminiscent of cranberries and bananas, cloves and nutmeg. The yeast fermentation also will create a slight sourness on the sides of the palate, a signature of the original Lambic style which, with the subtle cereal note from the wheat malt, remind its drinker that, as fruity a beer as this is, it is still a beer.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
