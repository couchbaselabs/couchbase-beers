{"_id":"beer_O'Hara's_Celtic_Stout","brewery":"Carlow Brewing Company","name":"O'Hara's Celtic Stout","abv":"4.3","description":"Unlike the image, does not have the creamy head like many Irish stouts (Beamish, Guinness, Murphys) and as a result lighter on the stomach and nice with a meal. Very distinctive taste which may put off those not accustomed to drinking stouts.I would recommend it for the more adventurous pallette.\r\n\r\nRoast barley comes through in the taste.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
