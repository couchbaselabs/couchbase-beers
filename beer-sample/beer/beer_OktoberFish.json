{"_id":"beer_OktoberFish","brewery":"Flying Fish Brewing Company","name":"OktoberFish","abv":"5.5","description":"First released in 2002, and sold out in two weeks. A tribute to the classic Fest styles of Germany the O'Fish uses European malts hops and yeast. A beautiful reddish color, a savory malt profile and nice hop flavor, make this Fest beer quite drinkable. OktoberFish is great with food and especially great with Lederhosen.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
