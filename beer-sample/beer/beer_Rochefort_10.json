{"_id":"beer_Rochefort_10","brewery":"Abbaye Notre Dame du St Remy","name":"Rochefort 10","abv":"11.3","description":"Reddish-brown colour, with a very compact head and an aroma of figs, feels like honey in the mouth. The alcohol profile is a major component in the flavour of this rich ale. It is very similar to 6 and 8, but has much more of everything. Some may find the high alcohol content to be disagreeable.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
