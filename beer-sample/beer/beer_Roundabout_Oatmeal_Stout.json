{"_id":"beer_Roundabout_Oatmeal_Stout","brewery":"Fifty Fifty Brewing Co.","name":"Roundabout Oatmeal Stout","abv":"6","description":"Everyone has their price. For some, it's measured in dollars per hour, for others it's powder days. For those that have the gift of passion for the dark side, it's measured in pints of Oatmeal Stout. Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year. Enjoy!","category":"British Ale","style":"Oatmeal Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
