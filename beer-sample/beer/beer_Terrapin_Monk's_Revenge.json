{"_id":"beer_Terrapin_Monk's_Revenge","brewery":"Terrapin Beer Company","name":"Terrapin Monk's Revenge","abv":"9.8","description":"This Belgian IPA has a malt bill of a Belgian Tripel and a hop bill of a Double IPA. The yeast I chose for this beer comes from one of the 7 Trappist breweries.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this is the first time in my professional brewing career that I have used dextrose (corn syrup) in a Terrapin brew. True to style no doubt.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Revenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d (otherwise known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Nasty\u00e2\u0080\u009d) has all the flavor and aroma of a Double IPA while hidden beneath lies the malt character of a fine Belgian Tripel.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my interpretation of this very fun style.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
