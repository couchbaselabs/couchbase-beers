{"_id":"beer_Truly_Honest_Ale","brewery":"Roy Pitz Brewing Company","name":"Truly Honest Ale","abv":"6","description":"Our signature brew that started it all. This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted\/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly \"Honest\" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale, unlike many other bitter American ales.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
