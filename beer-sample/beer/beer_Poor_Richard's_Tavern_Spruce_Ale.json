Some say he said it, others say he didn't. No one knows for sure. \r\n\r\nHistorical facts or fictions aside, Yards Brewing Company has recreated Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 to celebrate Franklin's affinity for fine ales. Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale is based on Franklin's original recipe, which called for spruce essence and molasses, as barley and hops were not readily available at the time.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a taste of history courtesy of Yards Brewing Company, Philadelphia's premier brewer and bottler.","category":"Other Style","style":"Herb and Spice Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
