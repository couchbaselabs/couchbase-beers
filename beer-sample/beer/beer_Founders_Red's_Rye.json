Brewed with four varieties of Belgian caramel malts imparting a sweet richness. Red's Rye is impressively balanced with its hop bitterness and huge citrus bouquet achieved from the immense amarillo dry hop. The generous amount of malted rye used accentuates a spicy crisp finish.","category":"Other Style","style":"American Rye Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
