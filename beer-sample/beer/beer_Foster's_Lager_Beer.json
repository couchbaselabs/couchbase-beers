Foster's\u00c2\u00ae Lager Beer has always been at the forefront of brewing technology and the Foster's\u00c2\u00ae Lager brewed today is the result of over a century of attention of the brewing art. Quality has been the strength of Foster's\u00c2\u00ae since its earliest days and remains a paramount concern at every stage of the beer's journey from brewery to consumer. Foster's\u00c2\u00ae crisp, clean flavour won it immediate international acclaim when it was first brewed in Melbourne in 1888. Today, more than one hundred years later, it is still recognized as one of the world's best beers.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
