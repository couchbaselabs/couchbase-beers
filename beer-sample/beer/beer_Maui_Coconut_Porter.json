It is black in color and crowned with a creamy, dark tan head.   It begins with a malty-toasted coconut aroma followed by a rich, silky feel with tastes of dark malt, chocolate, and hints of coffee.  It then finishes with flavors of  toasted coconut and hoppy spice to balance the finish.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
