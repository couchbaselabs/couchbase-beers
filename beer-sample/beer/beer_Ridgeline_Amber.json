Followed with a complex, nutty malt flavor true to its Scottish-style heritage, Ridgeline delivers unparalleled character and dimension. A touch of hops rounds out its silky, full body, highlighting Ridgeline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtle but engrossing character. Show your friends that you care about their taste buds by turning them on to our imminently balanced and perfectly complex Ridgeline Amber. \r\n\r\nOf interest to Great Divide historians \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ridgeline originally debuted at the brewery as Great Divide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first beer, Arapahoe Amber. It was renamed in 2004 to better reflect the Colorado lifestyle that Great Divide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beers perfectly complement.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
