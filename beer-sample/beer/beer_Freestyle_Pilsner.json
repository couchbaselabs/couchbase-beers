{"_id":"beer_Freestyle_Pilsner","brewery":"Santa Fe Brewing Company","name":"Freestyle Pilsner","abv":"5.5","description":"As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe original\u00e2\u0080\u009d pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line up.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Pilsener","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
