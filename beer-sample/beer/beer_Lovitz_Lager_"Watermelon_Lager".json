{"_id":"beer_Lovitz_Lager_\"Watermelon_Lager\"","brewery":"Roy Pitz Brewing Company","name":"Lovitz Lager \"Watermelon Lager\"","abv":"4.5","description":"This summertime lager is both smooth and refreshing as soon as it hits the lips. We take so much pride in it because there is truly nothing else like it on the market. We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
