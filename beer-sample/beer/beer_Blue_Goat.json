{"_id":"beer_Blue_Goat","brewery":"New Holland Brewing Company","name":"Blue Goat","abv":"7.5","description":"Chestnut in color with a nutty malt profile from its signature Munich malt. A muted hop presence and smooth caramelized body culminate in a clean, dry finish. Excellent choice for hearty meals with dark flavors and sauces. Grilled meats, musty cheeses or pecan pie.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
