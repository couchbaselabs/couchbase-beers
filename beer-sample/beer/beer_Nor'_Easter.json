{"_id":"beer_Nor'_Easter","brewery":"Captain Lawrence Brewing Company","name":"Nor' Easter","abv":"12","description":"This is a truly unique brew, combining some unusual elements to create a powerful, yet flavorful brew. I brewed a similar beer to this one back in 1998, while I was home brewing out in California. Only this time around I decided to age it in bourbon barrels to add a new element to the already rich sensory profile. The combination of dark malt, elderberries and bourbon barrels makes for an interesting tasting experience. This is a sippin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beer, so sit back by the fire and enjoy. 12% alcohol by volume.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
