{"_id":"beer_Paracelsus_Zwickl","brewery":"Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg GmbH","name":"Paracelsus Zwickl","abv":"5","description":"Paracelsus Zwickl is a natural beer specialty with a mellow impression on the tongue. The aftertaste unfolds a slight bitterness. Zwickl-beer is not filtered and therefore shows some cloudiness due to rests of yeast, minerals and trace elements.\r\n\r\nThis very special beer is brewing at its best using a sophisticated recipe combined with love and dedication. Stiegl only uses excellent ingredients from Austrian agricultural suppliers, applying biological techniques. As a result of this Paracelsus Zwickl beer was awarded the Bio-Austria certificate. Bio-production is subject to strict yearly controls by \u00e2\u0080\u009cAustria-Bio-Guaranty\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBier is a really divine medicine\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This quotation comes from Paracelsus (1493 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1541). He was a well known physician, forward thinker and visionary who lived in Salzburg for many years. He found out that beer had healing powers.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
