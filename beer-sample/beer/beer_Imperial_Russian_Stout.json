{"_id":"beer_Imperial_Russian_Stout","brewery":"Stone Brewing Co.","name":"Imperial Russian Stout","abv":"10.5","description":"Brewed in the authentic historical style of an Imperial Russian Stout, this ale is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, lack currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can --- and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
