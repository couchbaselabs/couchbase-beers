Schneider & Sohn GmbH","name":"Hopfen Weisse","abv":"8.2","description":"Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse is a collaboration between brewmasters Hans-Peter Drexler of the Schneider Weissbier Brewery and Garrett Oliver of the Brooklyn Brewery. Garrett and Hans-Peter have long admired each others beers. Now together they bring you a new sensation, a pale weissbock robustly dry-hopped with the Hallertauer Saphir variety grown in the fields near the Schneider brewery. Hoppy, zesty and supremely refreshing, Scheider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse is a delicious blend of Bavarian craftsmanship and American ingenuity.","category":"German Ale","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
