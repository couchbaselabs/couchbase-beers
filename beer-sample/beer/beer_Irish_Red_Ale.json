{"_id":"beer_Irish_Red_Ale","brewery":"Capital City Brewing Company","name":"Irish Red Ale","abv":"5.2","description":"Just in time for St. Patrick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day, this Irish style red ale definitely has a big malt profile.  This beer is the antithesis of our Amber Waves ale.  It has a low hop bitterness and aroma, this allows the caramel malt flavors to dominate.  It has a medium body, and is very easy going down.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Irish-Style Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
