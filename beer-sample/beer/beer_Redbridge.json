{"_id":"beer_Redbridge","brewery":"Anheuser-Busch","name":"Redbridge","description":"Redbridge beer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to make promises to stand out from the crowd; its very essence sets it apart. Redbridge is made without wheat or barley, so the approximately 3.2 million consumers who are unable to drink beer made with barley due to Celiac Disease or because they follow a wheat-free or gluten-free diet can once again enjoy a great tasting beer. Redbridge is a rich, full-bodied lager brewed from sorghum for a well-balanced, moderately hopped taste.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
