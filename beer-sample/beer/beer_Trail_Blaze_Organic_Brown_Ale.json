This is balanced against roasted caramel-like characteristics and hints of chocolate. \r\n\r\nOur first in a series of organic beers is named for the markers that keep a hiker on the correct path.  Many of the hiking trails in our area have simple to very distinguished trail blazes.  After a long hike, there is nothing better at the end of the trail than ABC organic ale.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
