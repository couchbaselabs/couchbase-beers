{"_id":"beer_HotRod_Red","brewery":"Aviator Brewing Company","name":"HotRod Red","abv":"6.1","description":"A somewhat classic Irish Red Ale.  This ale is feisty and a bit hoppy.  There is a malty sweetness and a somewhat dry finish.  Traditional East Kent Goldings but with a nice touch of Cascade and dash of roasted barley give this ale a great taste. ALWAYS AVAILABLE...or at least we try.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Irish-Style Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
