{"_id":"beer_Vigneronne","brewery":"Brasserie-Brouwerij Cantillon","name":"Vigneronne","abv":"5","description":"The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987. This name reminds us that, while it belongs to the beer patrimony, the spontaneous fermentation, the ageing in the barrels for several years and the addition of grapes make it a distant cousin of certain white wines.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery. In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
