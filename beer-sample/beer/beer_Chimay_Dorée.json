{"_id":"beer_Chimay_Dor\u00c3\u00a9e","brewery":"Chimay (Abbaye Notre Dame de Scourmont)","name":"Chimay Dor\u00c3\u00a9e","abv":"4.8","description":"Brewed from very similar ingredients as the Red, but paler and spiced differently. It is intended only to be drunk at the abbey or at the nearby inn Auberge de Poteaupr\u00c3\u00a9 which is associated with the abbey. The monks themselves drink this variety rather than the stronger three. The Dor\u00c3\u00a9e is not sold commercially and the rare bottles which make their way out are through unofficial sources. Even the brewery's own web site makes no mention of this variety.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
