{"_id":"beer_Liberation_Ale","brewery":"Live Oak Brewing","name":"Liberation Ale","abv":"6","description":"With about 6.0% ABV, this one will surely warm the ol' gullet during a cold central Texas winter - both days! Our India Pale Ale (IPA) is light in color and strong in hop character. Dry hopping with Cascade hops, gives this winter favorite a delicious citrus note reminiscent of a Texas Ruby Red. Yes, it's warming but you don't need to be huddled around the furnace to enjoy this one! IPA fans really love this ale during a beautiful Texas winter on the porch or indoors. Available December - April","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
