{"_id":"beer_Coors_Original","brewery":"Coors Brewing - Golden Brewery","name":"Coors Original","abv":"5","description":"Coors beer, first introduced by Adolph Coors in April, 1874, is brewed in the Rockies for a uniquely crisp, clean and drinkable \"Mile High Taste.\"\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Coors aided the war effort by setting aside half its beer for sale to the military.  When the service men and women returned home to states outside of Coors' original 11-state marketing region, they spread the word about the beer's taste and quality -- which became known as the \"Coors Mystique.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to its national expansion in the 1980s, Coors' limited distribution left consumers in the eastern U.S. wanting a taste of the Rocky Mountains' finest beer. President Gerald Ford was known to take several cases of Coors on his Air Force One during return trips to the White House.\r\n\r\nIn September 1893, Coors competed for the first time at the Chicago World's Fair and won awards for brilliancy, flavor, chemical analysis and commercial flavor.  The award-winning legacy of the brew continues and in recent years Coors beer has won a number of honors at beer festivals.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Light Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
