{"_id":"beer_Fresh_Hop_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Great Divide Brewing","name":"Fresh Hop Pale Ale","abv":"6.1","description":"The September hop harvest is a once-a-year opportunity to brew with fresh hops, also called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwet hops.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Given the perishable nature of just-harvested hop cones, they are shipped overnight to Great Divide shortly after harvest. The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.\r\n\r\nUsing fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing, medium bodied, light-copper colored pale ale.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
