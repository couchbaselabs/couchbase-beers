{"_id":"beer_Biscotti","brewery":"Lift Bridge Brewery","name":"Biscotti","abv":"7","description":"We drew inspiration from Steve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holiday biscotti recipe to create this one of a kind brew. By utilizing an array of malts, oats, wheat, pure local honey, light European hops and delicately spicing with Grains of Paradise, Madagascar vanilla beans, whole star anise, all brought together with traditional Belgian yeast, the result is a cloudy, deep copper colored, complex experience. This delight to the senses should be served in a 12 ounce footed glass and allowed to warm to 50 degrees to fully gather the malt and spice spectrum.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
