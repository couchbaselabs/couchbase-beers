Grab a seat on the porch, some soft cheese and a tree ripened apple from your grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old orchard. Relax and watch the evening arrive as the afternoon sun is consumed by the illuminating moon over the gardens. We brewed Avant Garde for you, our friends and families. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to things worth guarding over.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
