{"_id":"beer_Vivant_Tripel","brewery":"Brewery Vivant","name":"Vivant Tripel","abv":"9.25","description":"A classic golden ale, with subtle esters of banana and bubblegum. This beer pours with a creamy head and ends with a sweetness of light Belgian candi sugars. Our brewmaster aged this ale for an extended period to round out the flavors. A great traditional Belgian brew. ","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2011-06-22 12:22:12"}
