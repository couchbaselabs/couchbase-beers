Soft, subtle maltiness and a clean finish make it a great thirst-quencher. K\u00c3\u00b6lsch pairs well with spicy foods, or by itself. Enjoy with friends and in good health. Round Barn beer is bottle conditioned, decant into a pint glass before drinking for the best taste experience.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
