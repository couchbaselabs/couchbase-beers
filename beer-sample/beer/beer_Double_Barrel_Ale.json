We challenge our good friends across the pond to match this one. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve honored the traditions of the great British Pale brewers of Burton-on-Trent using our patented Firestone Union oak barrels. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with a mild blend of vanilla and toasted oak flavor touched with an elegant hint of English noble hops. DBA is the flagship of our company and wildly popular.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
