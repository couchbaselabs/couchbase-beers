This combination results in a clean, crisp, and refreshingly unique hand-crafted experience. Hoppy Brewing Company has never used any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors in any of its ales. The Hoppy label is your guarantee of purity.","category":"Other Style","style":"Winter Warmer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
