Forgotten by most is his evil side kick and enforcer of \u00e2\u0080\u0098the list\u00e2\u0080\u0099. European tradition says while St. Nick is busy delivering presents to good little boys and girls, Krampus hands out punishments to the bad. A fanged, goat-horned bully, the Christmas Devil uses sticks and chains to beat the naughty children. Dark malts and aromatic hops create the diabolical spirit of this brew. It is finished with lager yeast and aged cold for no less than 30 days. This Imperial Helles Lager will warm even the darkest hearts. \r\n\r\nThis season, replace the cookies with a bottle of Krampus. If he happens to pay a visit, toast to him with this devilish brew. Merry Kramp-mas to all, and to all a good pint!\r\n9.0% abv. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 20\u00c2\u00ba plato \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Imperial Helles Lager \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 22 oz \/ 1\/6 keg","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
