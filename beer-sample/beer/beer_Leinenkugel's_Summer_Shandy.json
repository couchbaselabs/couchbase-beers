A shandy is a lemonade flavored beer, a European favorite during the warmer months. And the light, crisp flavor makes it a great summer refresher. Each batch is carefully brewed using the finest wheat, malted barley and just a hint of real Wisconsin honey. Then, our brewmasters mix in fresh lemonade and citrus flavors to create an adventurous taste that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfect for those lazy days of summer.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
