{"_id":"beer_Golden_Delicious","brewery":"Captain Lawrence Brewing Company","name":"Golden Delicious","description":"There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing quite likes Mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apple pie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
