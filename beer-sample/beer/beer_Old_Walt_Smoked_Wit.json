{"_id":"beer_Old_Walt_Smoked_Wit","brewery":"The Blind Bat Brewery LLC","name":"Old Walt Smoked Wit","abv":"5","description":"A smoked wit, you say? \r\nYup. \r\n\r\nResearching smoked beers led me to a world of smoked wheat beers, particularly a smoked wheat beer popular in Poland about 100 years ago. (I'll list that one as one of the Blind Bat beers when I'm happy with the test batches and am ready to offer it to the public.) I didn't find anything about smoked wit beers, but decided to experiment a bit (a wit is a wheat beer). I like it, and hope you will too. \r\n\r\nPictured on the label is Long Island's old Walt Whitman, enjoying a smoke and a book in what is purported to be his favorite spot in his native West Hills. Long Island's springtime is awakening all around him.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
