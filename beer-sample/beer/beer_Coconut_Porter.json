{"_id":"beer_Coconut_Porter","brewery":"Appalachian Brewing Company","name":"Coconut Porter","description":"Based on the winning Homebrew Contest entry by John Slotterback and Fred Rogers, this dark, roasty porter is infused with fresh coconut which produces a sweet finish.  The coconut balances the chocolaty notes, producing a taste not unlike German chocolate cake in a glass! This will be brewed in Camp Hill and distributed in limited quantity to Harrisburg and Gettysburg.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
