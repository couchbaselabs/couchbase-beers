Peter Bouckaert, came to us from Rodenbach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 home of the fabled sour red. Our La Folie emulates the spontaneous fermentation beers of Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beloved Flanders with sour apple notes, a dry effervescence, and earthy undertones. New in 2010, we'll do a single bottling of La Folie for the year. Collect the 22oz unique to 2010 designed bottle and start a yearly wood-aged collection of goodness.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
