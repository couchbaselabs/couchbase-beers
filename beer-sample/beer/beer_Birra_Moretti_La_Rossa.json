The amber color that characterizes the beer, comes from the kind of malt used in the recipe (malt is dried, roasted barley). Another key ingredient is hops, the variety used is particularly aromatic, giving a characteristic bitter aftertaste and a delicate fragrance to the beer. The Master Brewers advise a service temperature between 10\u00c2\u00b0 and 12\u00c2\u00b0 C.","category":"German Lager","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
