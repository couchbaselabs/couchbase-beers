{"_id":"beer_Robust_Porter","brewery":"Smuttynose Brewing Co.","name":"Robust Porter","abv":"5.4","description":"This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cPorter\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate.","category":"Irish Ale","style":"Porter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
