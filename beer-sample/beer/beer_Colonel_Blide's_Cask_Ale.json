{"_id":"beer_Colonel_Blide's_Cask_Ale","brewery":"Cricket Hill","name":"Colonel Blide's Cask Ale","abv":"5.5","ibu":"31","description":"A tasty, moderately hoppy, easy to drink beer with an orange marmalade hue with a frothy, off-white head. An herbal hop aroma with a hint of lemon and pine. This beer is not overly bitter, with orangy citrus and pine hop with slight earthy notes! There is a malty biscuit flavor that balances the hops. Makes me wish I had some Fish & Chips!!","category":"British Ale","style":"Ordinary Bitter","updated":"2010-12-06 13:08:34"}
