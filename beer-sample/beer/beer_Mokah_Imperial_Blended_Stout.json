The classic utility-art aesthetic of the coffee maker is an example of design and engineering working in concert. \r\n\r\nIt is through similar cooperation that the simple bitter cocoa bean is transformed into a sweet treat. As scientists, our brewers utilize their materials to exacting standards. As artists, they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist the temptation to combine two of our highly acclaimed Blackwater Series Imperial Stouts: Jahva and Choklat. Alone each is perfect, but together as Mokah they are an inimitable expression of two of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most sought after flavors.
