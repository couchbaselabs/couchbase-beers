{"_id":"beer_Manifesto_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Fifty Fifty Brewing Co.","name":"Manifesto Pale Ale","abv":"5.3","description":"We at FiftyFifty believe that beer is good. Especially this beer. Manifesto is one of FiftyFifty's flagship beers. This beer is a delight for those who take pleasure in craft beers and are looking for something that they can enjoy a few pints of. Manifesto has a restrained malt backbone of flavor with mild biscuit and caramel notes, and the hop character is light to moderate with mild earthiness evolving to a slightly more moderate citrus\/piney finish. This is a beer of principle.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
