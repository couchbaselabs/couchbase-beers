{"_id":"beer_(512)_Bruin","brewery":"(512) Brewing Company","name":"(512) Bruin","abv":"7.6","description":"At once cuddly and ferocious, (512) BRUIN combines a smooth, rich maltiness and mahogany color with a solid hop backbone and stealthy 7.6% alcohol. Made with Organic 2 Row and Munich malts, plus Chocolate and Crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
