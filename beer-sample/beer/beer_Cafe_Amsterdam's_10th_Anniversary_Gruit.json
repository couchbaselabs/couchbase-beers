Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeer & wine license\u00e2\u0080\u009d and subsequently transformed the European-style caf\u00c3\u00a9 into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. \r\n\r\nThe cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right\u00e2\u0080\u0094 temperature, glass, presentation. \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\n\r\nGruit is an old style\u00e2\u0080\u0094one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Amsterdam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings. \r\n\r\nAvailability: \r\nAK - 22-oz bottles (limited release begins 05\/29\/2009)","category":"Other Style","style":"Fruit Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
