{"_id":"beer_Hop_Trip_Fresh_Hop_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Deschutes Brewery","name":"Hop Trip Fresh Hop Pale Ale","abv":"5.5","description":"This Fresh Hop Pale Ale is all about celebrating the hop harvest in the fall.  Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
