Born in Bavaria, Kosmos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mastery of German brewing carried him as far as Egypt before he found his way to the small Texas town of Shiner. Our proud brewery still carries his name and commitment to excellence in brewing. This full-flavored, hop-jacked lager is every bit as unique as the man himself and our way of saluting the brewmaster who started it all.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
