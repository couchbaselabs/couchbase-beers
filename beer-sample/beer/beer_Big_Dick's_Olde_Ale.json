{"_id":"beer_Big_Dick's_Olde_Ale","brewery":"Arcadia Brewing","name":"Big Dick's Olde Ale","abv":"8.2","description":"Somewhat of a cousin to Barleywine, Big Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is a classic English-style Olde Ale.  Sweet and full-bodied malt flavors are complemented by a fragrant but mild hop bitterness.  Sweet, bready malt aromas combine with rich flavors of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and sweet nuts. A beer for keeping, Big Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Olde Ale will age gracefully, while fruity flavors continue to develop and bitterness will subside.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a BIG beer, it is a Well-Endowed Ale!  We took a traditional English-style Ale and made it our own.  Delightful on its own or as a digestif with a full-bodied cigar, Big Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is also big enough to stand up to many boldly-flavored foods.","category":"British Ale","style":"Old Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
