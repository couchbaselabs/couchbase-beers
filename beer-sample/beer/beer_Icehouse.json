{"_id":"beer_Icehouse","brewery":"Miller Brewing","name":"Icehouse","abv":"5.5","description":"America's first domestic ice beer, Icehouse is traditionally brewed, fermented and, just before aging, its temperature is lowered to below freezing. This process imparts the beer's smoothness and an alcohol content that's slightly higher (5.5% by volume) than other regular premium beer brands. Icehouse was introduced in 1993 and has reinforced its position as the ultimate beer for wind-up and pre-game occasions. Blending humor and high-energy excitement, Icehouse marketing encourages its target consumers to take occasions to the next level with a great-tasting beer.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Light Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
