{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_OctoberFest","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams OctoberFest","abv":"5.7","description":"The first thing you notice when pouring a glass of this seasonal beer is the color. Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Octoberfest has a rich, deep golden amber hue which itself is reflective of the season. Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops. Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
