Our traditional brewing process gives this beer its subtle, complex and fruity character and its distinctive hop \"nose.\" The result is an exceptionally balanced premium full bodied ale that finishes clean and smooth on the palate. It appeals to gourmets and beer aficionados.\r\n\r\nOur goal in brewing the Dock Street Amber was to produce a phenomenal tasting American beer. At the time it was created, most all full-bodied beers were imports.\"","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
