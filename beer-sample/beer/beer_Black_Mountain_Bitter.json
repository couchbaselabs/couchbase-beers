{"_id":"beer_Black_Mountain_Bitter","brewery":"Highland Brewing Company","name":"Black Mountain Bitter","description":"A style of Pale Ale, Black Mountain Bitter will be lightly hopped with traditional British hop varieties to balance the malt sweetness yet encourage it to tend toward the dry side. We recently received our organic certification from Clemson University after undergoing a rigid inspection and two-month compliance process. Although this represents a big step for Highland, the idea of an all organic product is consistent with our corporate ethos and embrace of natural traditional brewing methods.","category":"British Ale","style":"Ordinary Bitter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
