{"_id":"beer_Yeti_Imperial_Stout","brewery":"Great Divide Brewing","name":"Yeti Imperial Stout","abv":"9.5","description":"Traditionally, Imperial Stouts, the biggest and boldest of all stouts, were brewed with massive amounts of roasted malts and hops, resulting in a velvety smooth but robust beer characterized by high alcohol content and extremely high hop bitterness. Meeting the challenge of this aggressive, challenging beer style, Great Divide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yeti Imperial Stout is an onslaught of the senses. An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yeti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
