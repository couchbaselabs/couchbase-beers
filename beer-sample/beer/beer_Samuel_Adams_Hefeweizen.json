{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Hefeweizen","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Hefeweizen","description":"Unfiltered wheat ale, fruity, bright, with a crisp flavor of wheat.  Samuel Adams\u00ae Hefeweizen beer is a traditional spin on a classic American craft brewing style. The brewers of Samuel Adams\u00ae used both malted and unmalted wheat, and two row Pale barley for a clean malty, cereal note. This bright, fruity wheat ale is unfiltered, retaining a natural haze from malt proteins, crisp, bright flavors of wheat, and fresh, fruity ester complexity from our proprietary ale yeast. Accentuated with Noble Spalt-Spalter hops, Samuel Adams\u00ae Hefeweizen has an elegant and pleasant bitterness, finishing smooth and clean.","category":"German Ale","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
