{"_id":"beer_Hop_Ottin_IPA","brewery":"Anderson Valley Brewing","name":"Hop Ottin IPA","abv":"7","description":"Hop Ottin' IPA is as hoppy as they come. The name means \"hard working hops,\" in Boontling, and that tells it all. Generous additions of high-alpha Pacific Northwest hops added during a vigorous boil, plus traditional dry hopping, with whole hop cones, give this ale a delicious citrus aroma, and an intense hoppy bite. This IPA is a hop lover's dream.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
