{"_id":"beer_Viszolay_Belgian","brewery":"Santa Fe Brewing Company","name":"Viszolay Belgian","abv":"7.5","description":"Viszolay is a distinctly continental ale with a hint of the southwest. Belgian malt, Bavarian and Czech hops, and a secret blend of German and Belgian yeast strains provide this beer, inspired by the Trappist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dubbel style ale, with a strong traditional base, while a hint of New Mexico wildflower honey infuses it with that ethereal quality that we New Mexicans simply call, \u00e2\u0080\u009cenchanting\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing. The hop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtle notes are overpowered by complex fruity flavors derived from the Belgian yeast, leaving Viszolay a very drinkable (yet rather potent) addition to the Santa Fe Brewing Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family of beers.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
