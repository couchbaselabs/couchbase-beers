It is\r\nbrewed from a blend of pale barley malt,\r\nwheat malt and unmalted wheat, to which\r\nwe blend selected spices and hops.\r\n \r\nBlanche de Chambly is only partially filtered,\r\nretaining its natural cloud of yeast that is\r\ncharacteristic of the original white ales\r\nbrewed during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWe recommend this remarkably refreshing","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
