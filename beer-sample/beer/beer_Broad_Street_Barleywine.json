{"_id":"beer_Broad_Street_Barleywine","brewery":"Appalachian Brewing Company","name":"Broad Street Barleywine","abv":"8.7","description":"Our Barley Wine is dark red in color and has an original gravity of 1.120 (24 Plato). The malt complexity of this classic ale style is incredible.\r\n\r\nThe Broad Street Market is located just blocks from the Appalachian Brewing Company. This indoor farmers market was built in 1863 and is one of the oldest continuously operating farmers markets in the United States. The beautiful brick fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and natural wood doors are typical of the structures in Downtown Harrisburg; including our own building.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
