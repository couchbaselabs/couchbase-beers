{"_id":"beer_Sun_Dog_Amber_Wheat","brewery":"Anheuser-Busch","name":"Sun Dog Amber Wheat","abv":"5.3","description":"Sun Dog is an unfiltered beer, with a naturally cloudy appearance and fuller texture which allows it to stand up to spicy foods like Thai noodle salads and Cuban sandwiches.  The beer is best served in a tall, wide-mouthed glass which opens up the aromas of the beer and showcases its beautiful long-lasting head of white foam.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
