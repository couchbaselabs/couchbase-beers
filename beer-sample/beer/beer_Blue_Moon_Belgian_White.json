{"_id":"beer_Blue_Moon_Belgian_White","brewery":"Coors Brewing - Golden Brewery","name":"Blue Moon Belgian White","abv":"5.4","description":"Blue Moon Belgian White, Belgian-style wheat ale, is a refreshing, medium-bodied, unfiltered Belgian-style wheat ale spiced with fresh coriander and orange peel for a uniquely complex taste and an uncommonly smooth finish.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Belgian White\" is a reference to the cloudy white, opaque appearance of the beer. \"Belgian White\" also refers to the style of beer, which has been brewed in Belgium for about 300 years. This type of ale is brewed with malt, wheat and oats. It is unfiltered, which allows protein and yeast to remain suspended in the beer and creates the cloudy appearance. This also adds to the smoothness and full body of the beer.\r\n\r\nPutting a new twist on the lime ritual, Blue Moon is traditionally served with a slice of orange.  Blue Moon was launched in 1995.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
