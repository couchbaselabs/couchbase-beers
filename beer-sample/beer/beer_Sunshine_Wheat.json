{"_id":"beer_Sunshine_Wheat","brewery":"New Belgium Brewing","name":"Sunshine Wheat","abv":"4.8","description":"SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst.  Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflection. Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of coriander and orange peel tartness, settling nicely into a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones.  A filtered wheat beer, Sunshine offers a crisp, refreshing alternative to heavier-bodied heffe-weizens.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
