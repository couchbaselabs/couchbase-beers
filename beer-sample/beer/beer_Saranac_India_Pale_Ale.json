In the India Pale Ale tradition this brew is very hoppy in both aroma and flavor from the generous amounts of cascade hops used in brewing. Look for a medium to full body and golden straw color.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
