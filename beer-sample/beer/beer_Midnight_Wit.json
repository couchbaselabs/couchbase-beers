{"_id":"beer_Midnight_Wit","brewery":"Legacy Brewing Co.","name":"Midnight Wit","abv":"4.8","description":"Midnight Wit is a Belgian-style white ale with a medium body and spicy, citrus overtones. The texture is silky, creamy, and refreshingly delightful. Brewed with European Pilsner malt, unmalted wheat, a blend of 5 different spices and then fermented with a classic Belgian yeast strain. Our Brewmaster learned the art of brewing tantalizing and award-winning white beers during his time in Belgium and this beer shows it.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style White","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
