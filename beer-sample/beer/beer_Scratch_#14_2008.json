The nicely carbonated brew releases a honey-malt flavor that gives way to a tart crisp finish that masks the elevated ABV.\r\n\r\nWe use a blended yeast strain (Saison Dupont & Le Chouffe) to create the traditional peppery, spicy earthy flavors of the saison. Slight hints of ginger also come through in the finish.\r\n\r\nDrink it \u00e2\u0080\u0098til the wedding bells chime!","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
