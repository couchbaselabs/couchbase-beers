{"_id":"beer_Phoenixx_Double_ESB","brewery":"Real Ale Brewing Company","name":"Phoenixx Double ESB","abv":"7.2","description":"Our winter seasonal is inspired by the great ales of the UK but brewed with a distinctively American attitude. English crystal malt gives Phoenixx its subtle toffee and caramel notes, but this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew.","category":"British Ale","style":"Extra Special Bitter","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
