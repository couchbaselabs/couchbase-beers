This beer demonstrates a unique balance of malt-inspired, delicate red grapefruit sweetness and lingering hop dryness. The OG and final ABV provide the structure and body to balance the harmony of distinct flavours. Cascade, Warrior, Summit and Glacier Hops are used for bittering and Cascade Hops are added for dry hopping after fermentation. This hop blend is well balanced with Malted Wheat, Pale Ale, Crystal, and Caramalt Malts. To fully enjoy all the flavours, this ale is best drunk at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. This beer pairs well with Cajun dishes, blackened fish, and BBQ. XXXX draws its name from the British brewing convention of using X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to denote style. 70 BU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, 1.092 OG, 9.25% ABV.","category":"North American Ale","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
