{"_id":"beer_Harpoon_IPA","brewery":"Harpoon Brewery - Windsor","name":"Harpoon IPA","abv":"5.9","description":"From their site:\r\n\r\n\"Harpoon IPA is an interpretation of the classic English style using hops and malt grown in the United States.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"The high hopping of Harpoon IPA is not only noticeable in the nose but especially in the finish. The lingering bitter finish of this beer is not harsh or astringent, but crisp and pronounced. This is created, in part, by dry hopping \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a technique that involves adding fresh hops to the conditioning beer to provide a fresh hop aroma.\r\n\r\nThis beer is floral, medium body with an aggressive, clean hop finish.\"\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis has been my year-round favorite since moving to Boston in 2004.  It is the nectar of the gods.  Seriously, it's a nicely balanced, hoppy IPA that isn't overpowering.  Also, it can be consumed in huge quantities with no hangover.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
