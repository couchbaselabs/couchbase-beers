During a two-year aging period the horsy flavors of the brett combined with the Westmalle yeast used during primary fermentation to create a complex blend of flavors. Bone-dry and 12% abv, Splinter Gold is highly carbonated.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
