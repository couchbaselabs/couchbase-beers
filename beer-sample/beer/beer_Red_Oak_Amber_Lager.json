{"_id":"beer_Red_Oak_Amber_Lager","brewery":"Red Oak Brewery","name":"Red Oak Amber Lager","description":"Red Oak Amber is a Munich Urtyp (Old Style) Lager. We begin the brewing process with custom kilned imported Munich Malt.  Red Oak is then hopped with Spalt Noble Hops imported from Bavaria, the oldest hop growing region in the world.  Before fermentation we add a yeast strain from Weihenstephen, the oldest brewery in the world, founded before 1040 AD. Weeks of aging gives Red Oak the smooth taste it is known for.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
