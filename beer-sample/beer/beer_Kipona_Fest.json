The distinct toasted malt flavor of this amber lager finishes quite crisp due to the extensive lagering of this beer. One sip and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in Munich.\r\n\r\n\"Kipona\" is the Indian word for \"sparkling water\". Each year, over Labor Day weekend, Harrisburg celebrates Kipona with a carnival and festival along the Susquehanna River and on City Island.","category":"German Lager","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
