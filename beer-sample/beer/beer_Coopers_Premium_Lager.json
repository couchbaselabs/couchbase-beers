{"_id":"beer_Coopers_Premium_Lager","brewery":"Coopers Brewery","name":"Coopers Premium Lager","abv":"5","description":"Coopers Premium Lager is quite different to the famous Coopers ales.  This lager produces a refreshing flavour with a good balance of malt and hop characters and is brewed using no sugar. With its subtle fruity esters and light golden colour, combined with a judicious blend of Pride of Ringwood and Saaz hops.  This produces a Lager with a crisp malty full flavour.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
