{"_id":"beer_Ipswich_IPA","brewery":"Mercury Brewing Company","name":"Ipswich IPA","abv":"6.3","description":"Our IPA is an unfiltered cross between an English and American IPA, with a strong, dry bitterness balanced with a slight malty sweetness. A mixture of first-rate U.S. and Belgian malts, combined with English roasted barley and highly hopped with Cascade and Warrior hops make our IPA a brewery favorite.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
