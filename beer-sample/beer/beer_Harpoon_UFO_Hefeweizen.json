{"_id":"beer_Harpoon_UFO_Hefeweizen","brewery":"Harpoon Brewery - Boston","name":"Harpoon UFO Hefeweizen","abv":"4.8","description":"From Harpoon's site:\r\n\r\n\"UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer.  Perhaps UFO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.\r\n\r\nThe overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.  Serve with a lemon.\"","category":"German Ale","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
