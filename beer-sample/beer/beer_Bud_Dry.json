{"_id":"beer_Bud_Dry","brewery":"Anheuser-Busch","name":"Bud Dry","abv":"5","description":"Introduced in 1989 Bud Dry is the first dry-brewed beer produced by an American brewer. It is brewed with select hops, grains and barley malt, which results in a lighter body and less-sweet taste. As with all Anheuser-Busch beers, it is cold-filtered for a smooth draft taste, but then goes through a second cold-filtered finishing process to provide its unique taste.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Light Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
