{"_id":"beer_Otter_Creek_Imperial_India_Pale_Ale","brewery":"Otter Creek Brewing & Wolaver's Organic Ales","name":"Otter Creek Imperial India Pale Ale","abv":"11","description":"Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.\r\nOur Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.\r\n\r\nThis beer is 11% alcohol by volume, and 135 IBU!","category":"North American Ale","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
