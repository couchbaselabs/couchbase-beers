{"_id":"beer_Bender_Beer","brewery":"Surly Brewing","name":"Bender Beer","abv":"5.1","description":"This beer is an amalgamation of styles; brown\/porter\/apa. Five distinct malts, including two from Belgium, give this beer added complexity and depth. We also add oatmeal to this beer to give it a smooth texture not usually associated with this type of beer. We add large amounts of American finishing hops to give Bender a citrus hop aroma because... we like hops. This is a session beer weighing in around 5% alcohol and 25 IBUs. Grab one today, we think you will want another!","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
