This mildly hopped copper colored brew has a rich smooth taste.  Hop varieties such as Styrian Goldings and English Fuggles are used to balance the beers maltiness.  A technique called dry hopping is used after fermentation to add fresh herbal aroma.  It is a great session beer and was made to satisfy a wide variety of palates.  Drink and enjoy LaPorte County's first production craft beer.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
