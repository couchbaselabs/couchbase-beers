{"_id":"beer_Quelque_Chose","brewery":"Unibroue","name":"Quelque Chose","abv":"8","description":"Quelque Chose was launched in January 1996. This versatile beer was specifically developed as a winter beer because, when warmed to 70\u00c2\u00baC (160\u00c2\u00baF), it can be taken as a hot drink. On the other hand, on the rocks, it is a wonderful aperitif. The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts.","category":"Belgian and French Ale","style":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
