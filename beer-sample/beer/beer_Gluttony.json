Its deep decadent golden orange color presents an appetizing invitation for extravagant enjoyment. Its aroma entices with citrus, pine and alcohol while the flavor provides a smorgasbord of sweet malt, fresh tangerine\/grapefruit and a resinous hop character that lingers well beyond the finish. \r\n\r\nGLUTTONY...More than a mouthful.","category":"North American Ale","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
