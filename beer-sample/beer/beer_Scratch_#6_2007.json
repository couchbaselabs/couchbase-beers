After combining barley and water we transfer a portion of the mash to the brew kettle for a quick boil. The heated mash is then returned to the mash kettle and the brewing process continues. This process deepens the malt character and adds a subtle toffee backbone to this delicious lager.\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added Magnum hops for bittering and Czech Saaz hops for aroma to create a classic European Noble hop flavor. \r\n\r\nScratch #6-2007 is unfiltered, so there will be a slight haze to the beer.","category":"North American Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
