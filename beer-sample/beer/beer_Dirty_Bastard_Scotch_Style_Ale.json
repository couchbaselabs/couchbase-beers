{"_id":"beer_Dirty_Bastard_Scotch_Style_Ale","brewery":"Founders Brewing","name":"Dirty Bastard Scotch Style Ale","abv":"8.5","description":"Founders flagship beer. Dirty Bastard is an absolute beautiful beer to behold. Dark ruby in color and brewed with ten varieties of imported malts this beer continuously lives up to its reputation as a bold and powerful ale. Dirty Bastard is complex in the finish with hints of smoke and peat paired with a malty richness, finalized with a good bit of hop attitude.  This beer ain't for the wee lads.","category":"British Ale","style":"Scotch Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
