{"_id":"beer_Seigneuriale","brewery":"Unibroue","name":"Seigneuriale","abv":"7.5","description":"The copper-colored body and generous foam\r\nhead of this amber ale tantalize the eyes but\r\nit's the complex flavor of Seigneuriale that\r\ndelivers a pleasant surprise. It is slightly\r\nsweet, malty and spicy, but a distinctive hop\r\ncharacter and notes of apricot brandy give\r\nSeigneuriale a truly unique character. \r\n\r\nWe recommending pairing it with carved ham,\r\napricot-glazed duck or squab, Thai shrimp\r\ncurry or a holiday fruit cake.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
