{"_id":"beer_Old_BullDog_Extra_Special","brewery":"Aviator Brewing Company","name":"Old BullDog Extra Special","abv":"5.8","description":"A hearty extra special beer or basically a pale ale on steroids.  A dark amber beer with a rich blend of  malts.  The base malt is full kilned pale 2-row barley and is combined with full tasting crystal malt.  This beer has a great heavy late hop addition of East Kent Goldings (that cost us our lunch money for weeks...). ALWAYS AVAILABLE or at least we try.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
