{"_id":"beer_Darkness","brewery":"Surly Brewing","name":"Darkness","abv":"10.3","description":"This Russian Imperial Stout is a sipper. Problem is that you want to sip it all night. Look for this one to be released when the leaves change color and Halloween is approaching. Brewed with a blend of 8 different malts, oats and candi sugar. This huge stout reflects Surly's commitment to brewing intensely flavored beers in small batches. Only 25 barrels of this beer were brewed.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
