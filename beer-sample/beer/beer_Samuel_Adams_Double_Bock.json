{"_id":"beer_Samuel_Adams_Double_Bock","brewery":"Boston Beer Company","name":"Samuel Adams Double Bock","abv":"8.8","description":"Intense and warming, a meal in a bottle.\r\nOne can not help but appreciate Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Double Bock's huge malt character. We use an enormous amount of malt, half a pound per bottle, to brew this intensely rich lager. Its deep brown-ruby color is all made in the kettle - no black malt is used, resulting in a rich sweetness that is free of the rough taste of burnt malt. All that remains is the velvet smooth flavor and mouthfeel of the two row malt. Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Double Bock's intense malt character is balanced with a subtle piney, citrus hop note from the German Noble hops.\r\n\r\nDue to legal restrictions, Samuel Adams\u00c2\u00ae Double Bock can not be sold in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.","category":"German Lager","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
