{"_id":"beer_Tracktown_IPA","brewery":"Rogue Ales","name":"Tracktown IPA","abv":"7","description":"Offering a hop-heads paradise, this unfiltered Northwest-Style India Pale Ale introduces a big floral hop character to the aroma, flavor and finish. Hops, Hops, Hops from front to back but nicely offset with a malty richness that prevents this ale from being overbearing. Tracktown is made from 100% Floor Malted Maris Otter, 100% Northwest Amarillo Hops, Free Range Coastal Water, and absolutely No Chemicals, Additives, or Preservatives.","category":"North American Ale","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
