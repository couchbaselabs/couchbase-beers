{"_id":"beer_Round_Barn_Summer_Wheat","brewery":"The Round Barn Winery & Brewery","name":"Round Barn Summer Wheat","description":"An unpretentious American pale wheat beer, our Summer Wheat pours a cloudy golden-orange, just like a sunset over Lake Michigan. Its assertive wheat flavor is complimented with hints of citrus zest. Garnish with a slice of orange or lemon. Round Barn beer is bottle conditioned, decant into a weizen glass before drinking for the best taste experience.","category":"Other Style","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
