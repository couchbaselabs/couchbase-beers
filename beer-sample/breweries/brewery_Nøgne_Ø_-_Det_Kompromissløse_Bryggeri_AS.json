Unable to stay at home we started Norway's first microbrewery for creative brewing. Some times, when we get a momentary glimpse of sanity, we ask ourselves what we have achieved. We think we can say that we have achieved some level of fame, at least locally and among dedicated beer geeks around the world. But more important - before we started N\u00c3\u00b8gne \u00c3\u0098 most Norwegians did not know much about beer styles like IPA, Porter or Amber. This has for sure started to change, and we do feel that we have contributed to what you can call a renaissance of Norwegian beer-culture.  Diversity was one of our main goals - and it does seem like diversity in the world of beers is starting to come back.","geo":{"loc":[]},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
