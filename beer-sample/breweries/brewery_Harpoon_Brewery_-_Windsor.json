{"_id":"brewery_Harpoon_Brewery_-_Windsor","name":"Harpoon Brewery - Windsor","address":["336 Ruth Carney Drive"],"city":"Windsor","state":"Vermont","code":"5089","country":"United States","phone":"1-802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","description":"We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because, like today, we loved beer and wanted more good choices.  While traveling in Europe after college, we drank many wonderfully diverse, fresh, local beers.  We also saw firsthand how important local breweries were to their communities.  After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.  We hope that our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.","geo":{"loc":["-72.4015","43.513"],"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
