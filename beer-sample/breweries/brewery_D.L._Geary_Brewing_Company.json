Geary Brewing Company was incorporated in October, 1983 by David and Karen Geary who shared the vision of producing world class products on a small scale for local and regional consumption. At that time, there were only 13 so-called microbreweries in the United States, almost all of them in California and the Pacific Northwest. In the winter of 1984, David Geary began a period of training and research in Scotland and England. With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in a half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England.","geo":{"loc":["-70.3149","43.7076"],"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
