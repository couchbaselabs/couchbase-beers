{"_id":"brewery_Timmermans","name":"Timmermans","address":["Kerkstraat 11"],"city":"Itterbeek","code":"1701","country":"Belgium","phone":"3225690357","website":"http:\/\/www.anthonymartin.be\/","description":"Timmermans brews only traditional Lambic; the basic beer that, from spontaneous fermentation, is used throughout the entire range. Brewing Lambic, without adding yeast, is a complex and subtle art requiring recipes and patience passed on by the family. Lambics survive thanks to a handful of Brussels breweries and the presence of two micro-organisms that exist only in the Senne Valley: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis and Brettanomyces Lambicus. By adding fruit and spices, the magic of traditionallymade beers unravels: Strawberry, Kriek, P\u00c3\u00aache, Framboise, Forest Fruit, but also Oude Gueuze, Kriek Retro, Gueuze, Faro or Lambicus Blanche. A unique site: open daily (including weekends), booking required. Possibilities for your meetings and banquets.","geo":{"loc":["4.2475","50.8399"],"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
