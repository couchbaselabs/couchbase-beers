So, here in Jackson Hole, we only produce about 5,000 barrels of award-winning beer per year. We operate a 15 barrel, steam fired brew house and hand craft our lagers and ales using several yeast strains along with hops and grains from the United States, British Isles and Europe. The SRB Brewery was also granted Organic certification in 2007 allowing us to create our first Organic Certified beer OB-1, an english style brown ale, which is fast becoming a favorite among our patrons.","geo":{"loc":["-110.765","43.4768"],"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
