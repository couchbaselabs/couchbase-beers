The Sea Dog in Topsham occupies a scenic spot on the Androscoggin River. The Bangor location overlooks the historic Penobscot River. Both locations serve a full menu of handcrafted ales and creative pub fare with a flair. Being authentic is important to us. Our beers are brewed in a traditional style using only the highest quality ingredients like imported English two-row malted barley and British top-fermenting yeast. Our English brewing style results in brews with a distinctive, refreshing taste and crisp finish unique to top-fermented beers.","geo":{"loc":["-68.77","44.7974"],"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}
